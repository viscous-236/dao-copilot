      "title": "Strategic Renewal of Gnosis, Linea, and Mantle Deployments",
      "body": "GFX Labs initially posted this [proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/strategic-renewal-for-support-of-uniswap-v3-deployments/25723?u=gfxlabs) on the forum this summer and has been hoping that the quorum/delegation situation would improve. It seems to have improved thanks to the Unification initiative.\n\nBased on recent feedback from delegates, we propose renewing the Linea deployments (lapsed in May), Mantle (lapsed in August), and Gnosis (lapsed in September).\n\nThe high-level reasoning to continue with these three deployments is the following:\n\nMantle - High level of TVL ($325M), upcoming Aave deployment, and relatively high amount of activity onchain.\nGnosis - Uniswap v3 is the primary DEX on Gnosis with $25M TVL.\nLinea - Although Consensys\u2019 Linea has had a volatile TVL, the opportunity for Uniswap on Linea is still strong, and the potential for Aerodrome or another fork to win over the domain if Uniswap steps out is likely.\nAdditionally, none of these deployments are available on app.uniswap.org.\n\nWe already deprecated Blast and Polygon zkEVM from Oku. Both offboardings went smoothly, and we have built a tool for users to close their lingering positions on deprecated chains so they do not need to do so manually.\n\nThe DAO also sponsored Taiko, but based on the activity and some delegate feedback, we will move to deprecate it. Separate from the DAO, Oku has been supporting Scroll unpaid for nearly two years. Given the limited activity, we will also deprecate the deployment in our interface.\n\nIn line with historical pricing, Uniswap v3 deployments carry a $5K/month maintenance cost to cover the cloud hosting, indexing, RPC costs, support, and general maintenance. If this proposal is approved $180K from UNI will be transferred to the UAC, and the UAC will process the payment.",

Turning on Uniswap protocol fees and using these fees to burn UNI  \n2. Sending Unichain sequencer fees to this same UNI burn mechanism  \n3. Building Protocol Fee Discount Auctions (PFDA) to increase LP returns and allow the protocol to internalize MEV  \n4. Developing aggregator hooks, turning Uniswap v4 into an onchain aggregator that collects fees on external liquidity  \n5. Burning 100 million UNI from the treasury, representing the approximate amount of UNI that would have been burned if fees were on from the beginning  \n6. Focusing Labs on driving protocol development and growth, including turning off Labs\u2019 interface, wallet, and API fees, and contractually committing to only pursue initiatives that align with DUNI interests  \n7. Moving ecosystem teams from the Foundation to Labs, with a shared goal of protocol success, with growth and development funded from the treasury  \n8. Migrating governance-owned Unisocks liquidity from Uniswap v1 on mainnet to v4 on Unichain and burning the LP position, locking in the supply curve forever\n\n***Legal Disclaimer***  \n*Labs\u2019 focus on driving protocol development and growth along with other contractual commitments will be outlined under the service provider agreement (SPA) between [DUNI](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-establish-uniswap-governance-as-duni-a-wyoming-duna/25770) and Uniswap Labs. If this Snapshot vote is successful, it explicitly authorizes a special independent committee of the Uniswap Foundation, as Ministerial Agent to DUNI, to negotiate the full SPA based on the [draft](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yXv2fm1XMr1eOsSMzG4DloGzvkFEYc1-/view) letter of intent. This independent committee composed of Ben Jones, co-founder of Optimism and Chief Scientist of the Optimism Foundation (disclosure: Unichain is built on the OP Stack and a part of the Optimism Superchain), and Hart Lambur, co-founder of the Across Protocol and UMA Protocol, will be appointed by the Foundation to lead negotiations on behalf of DUNI. The final negotiated agreement will be provided prior to the full onchain vote and executed by DUNI upon its passing. A successful onchain vote would also constitute DUNI\u2019s agreement to indemnify the independent committee and its members. An indemnification agreement would be provided at the time of the onchain vote for DUNI review and approval, along with the fully negotiated SPA. **We recommend everyone read the [proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/unification-proposal/25881) in full. The summary above is intended to provide a high-level overview of key points in the proposal, and is not a substitute for reading the full proposal.***",

      "title": "Uniswap Community Proposal Factory",
      "body": "**Summary & Motivation**\nGFX Labs and its team have participated in protocol governance for over four years. In fact, Getty\u2019s first governance proposal was a Compound Crowd Proposal, also known as a [Compound Autonomous Proposal](https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-autonomous-proposals-354e7a2ad6b7) (CAP), in September 2020. At the time, to make a Compound Proposal a contributor needed 100k COMP (~$14m) votes. While that was unattainable for most contributors, CAPs allowed anyone with 100 COMP ($14k) to make an Autonomous Proposal.\n\nAt its core, a CAP allowed smaller users a path to make a proposal through the primary governance contract by first proposing it to the CAP. Once the CAP was created, the creator needed to lobby community members to delegate their voting power to the CAP, and once that voting weight reached 100k, it was eligible to become a proposal for the DAO.\n\nIn concept, CAPs were a great solution to get small, intelligent, and valuable participants engaged in protocol governance. Most delegates, however, could not delegate their COMP tokens to a CAP. Unfortunately, because delegations cannot be re-delegated except by the token holder, CAPs only democratized proposal power at the margins. We\u2019ve also seen this at Uniswap for those who remember [fish.vote](https://www.fish.vote/).\n\nTo solve this problem, we are introducing the [Community Proposal Factory](https://gfx.cafe/gfx/legos) (CPF), the modern version of a CAP, which can propose, and then support by voting upon, a proposal by first clearing a lower-level vote.\n\n**Overview**\nThe CPF is effectively a subDAO of a larger protocol with a significantly lower proposal threshold.\n\nAnyone who meets the proposal threshold can create a Community Proposal. This can be thought of as a proposal seeking to attract and pool the voting power of multiple UNI holders and delegates to meet the proposal threshold.\n\nIf the Community Proposal receives a sufficient number of votes to initiate a standard proposal, the CPF pushes the proposal to the primary governance contract as a standard proposal, and at that point, governance proceeds as it does today. This structure removes the need for new delegations to be made for each CAP, and instead, governance token holders may leave their delegation on the CPF.\n\nCommunity Proposal Factories effectively lower the proposal threshold without an increase in security risks to the DAO. In doing so, we feel Community Proposals will represent a big step in democratizing proposal power.\n\nOnce deployed, anyone can craft a proposal with executable code without needing a large amount of capital (or commanding the delegated votes of a large amount of capital), and the broader governance tokenholder community can judge whether the proposal should advance to a full vote. It also filters spam proposals before hitting the main voting venue, since it is optional for UNI holders and delegates to vote on a Community Proposal.\n\nThe [Community Proposal Factory](https://gfx.cafe/gfx/legos) is compatible with Governor Bravo-based DAOs and can be easily deployed by anyone. Each deployer can configure the factory to their DAO, requiring only minor configurations. In addition, this concept could be applied to other common governance frameworks such as OpenZeppelin\u2019s Governor. Deployed CPFs can spin up an interface easily using [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/).\n![Screenshot 2025-09-29 at 7.51.09\u202fPM.png](ipfs://bafkreidgh43p54jlunkg7phkm64su3eqsq4x2a2gawdc3t7ds6i7z2byjq)\n\nThe above diagram is an example of how a Community Proposal Factory could be applied to Uniswap. In this example, the factory is deployed with the Uniswap Governor Bravo contract as the parent DAO contract, the UNI token as the governance token for the factory, a proposal threshold of 100 UNI votes, and a quorum of 10M UNI.\n\nAnyone with 100 UNI can create a Community Proposal within the CPF. Similar to a regular vote, if the proposal reaches the necessary quorum (10M UNI), then the proposal is deemed successful.\n\nIf the proposal is successful and if the Uniswap CPF has the required voting power delegated to it, the execute function will create the proposal on the Uniswap Governor Bravo contract, and then vote in favor of it when the voting begins.\n\nAt this point, the governance process is identical to any other vote. The proposal will go through the standard review, voting \u2013 and, if successful \u2013 timelock before execution.\n\nBecause the CPF is self-contained and cannot pass a standard proposal more easily than a human delegate, funds & protocol functions are not believed to be at increased risk. As a result, we do not believe the expense of an audit is required, but we can add additional funding to the proposal to cover one if delegates are strongly in favor.\n\nInitial parameters (review period, voting period, timelock) within the CPF will be within standard governance practices, and can be fine-tuned for the final Tally vote if delegates have strong opinions. Multiple proposals are queued for submission to Governor Bravo in order of their passage at the CPF level. Should a backlog of proposals by the CPF to Governor Bravo be expected, multiple CPFs could be deployed, requiring additional treasury delegation.\n\n**Deployment**\n1. [Configure CPF and deploy](https://gfx.cafe/gfx/legos). Anyone can do this, and you only need to do it once. Parameters such as the proposal threshold and quorum can be changed by the CPF\u2019s voters.\n\n2. Delegate 20M UNI from the DAO treasury to the CPF to ensure not only the ability to propose, but also end quorum failures due to low active voting supply.\n\n**Proposal Process**\n1. Anyone with 100 UNI votes can post a Community Proposal to the CPF.\n\n2. UNI voters can vote on CPF proposals if they wish. If the For votes cast meet or exceed the 10M UNI quorum and outnumber the Against votes, then the proposal can be proposed by the CPF to the Uniswap governance contract. At this point, the CPF must have the sufficient votes delegated to it to make the proposal on the parent contract and must maintain the voting power for the duration of the standard proposal.\n\n3. After the standard proposal is made, it is up to the DAO\u2019s standard process to determine if the proposal is executed.\n\n**Specification**\n1. GFX Labs or another contributor will deploy a Community Proposal Factory for Uniswap.\n\n2. Uniswap governance delegates 20M UNI [from the DAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc) to the CPF via the franchiser.\n\n3. Uniswap governance provides $75,000 in UNI to gfxlabs.eth to cover the expense of development and testing.\n\nThe Community Proposal Factory will safeguard the ability to continue protocol governance while maintaining the security and integrity of the DAO. By streamlining the process for smaller token holders to introduce executable proposals and aggregate support, the CPF empowers a broader range of contributors without requiring prohibitive amounts of capital or delegation.\n\nUltimately, the CPF strengthens community engagement, filters low-quality proposals, and provides lubricant to the gears of Uniswap governance, helping to mitigate the ongoing attrition amongst active voting supply.",

      "body": "Voting Options: Allocate $250k, Don\u2019t Allocate, Abstain\n\u2014--------------------------------------\n\nThis post intends to accomplish two purposes:\n\n* Publicly signal the UAC\u2019s intent to eventually allocate $250k from the incentives discretionary budget to the Plasma deployment. This is tranche 1.\n\n* Collaborate with Plasma to request an additional $250k from the treasury via the customary governance path (RFC, Snapshot, Onchain vote). **This vote pertains to tranche 2.**\n\n### [READ THE FULL PROPOSAL ON THE FORUM.](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/grow-uniswap-on-plasma/25835)\n\n### Incentive Structure & Timing:\n\n**Goal: Plasma allocates $3-5M in XPL incentives over 6 months, while Uniswap co-incentivizes with $500k UNI.**\n\n* Plasma\u2019s commitment: Deploy up to $5M in incentives over six months, tied to the XPL token price. A minimum of $500k/month is guaranteed, ensuring at least $3 million total if XPL declines.\n\n* Uniswap\u2019s discretionary tranche ($250k): Allocated from the UAC\u2019s incentives discretionary budget. Currently unallocated due to pending legal review.\n\n* Catch-up mechanism: Once the UAC is able, it will \u201ccatch up\u201d to Plasma by distributing the full $250k within the remaining months (e.g. if legal review takes 1 month, the UAC will allocate $50k/month over 5 months instead of $41.6k/month over 6).\n\n* Parallel Plasma incentives: Plasma agreed to begin allocating incentives on day-one, before the DAO is able to allocate capital on its end. XPL incentives have been live since September 25 and can be [viewed here](https://rewards.plasma.to/protocols/uniswap?tokenType=all&sort=tvl-desc). TVL has currently reached $56M, with over $1B in volume since launch.\n\n* Second tranche ($250k): The discretionary budget has a $250k cap, so we are requesting a $250k match from the DAO treasury. **This snapshot pertains to the second tranche.**\n\n### Allocation Breakdown:\n\nOnce able, Uniswap will begin abiding by the following allocation:\n\n\n* XPL/USD\u20ae0 - 20% of incentives\n\n* USDe/USD\u20ae0 - 25% of incentives\n\n* ETH/USD\u20ae0 - 25% of incentives\n\n* weETH/USD\u20ae0 - 20% of incentives\n\n* XAUT/USD\u20ae0 - 10% of incentives\n\nUniswap's allocation will differ from that of Plasma, which has a heavy focus on XPL/USD\u20ae0:\n\n* XPL/USD\u20ae0 - 70% of incentives\n\n* ETH/USD\u20ae0 - 10% of incentives\n\n* weETH/USD\u20ae0 - 10% of incentives\n\n* XAUT/USD\u20ae0 - 10% of incentives\n\nSome of the Plasma incentives may also be allocated to pools focused on ecosystem-native assets such as Axis, Daylight, Uranium Digital, and other unannounced issuers.",

The following nominees have been validated as eligible for inclusion during the first application phase.\n\n**Voting Process:** The DAO will allocate voting power to each candidate as it sees fit. At the end of the voting period, all delegates will be ranked in order from the most to the least votes received. Sequentially from the top of the list to the bottom, each delegate will receive delegated voting power up to the point at which they individually hold 2.5M total VP. Then, the process repeats for the next delegate, and the next, until all VP has been allocated.\n\n**Self-Voting Policy:** Because this election is not for a finite number of seats, and it is best to encourage broader distribution of votes, self-voting will not leverage the max-matching model seen during committee elections. Instead, each voter will be eligible to commit a maximum of 25% to himself or herself and distribute the remainder as they see fit. \n\n**Violation Policy:** If a delegate violates the self-voting policy, the portion of their voting power allocated to themself will be considered void. Any portion allocated toward other delegates will persist.\n\n**Ranking and Distribution Calculations:** After election closure, all nominees will be ranked in order of most to least votes received, and the waterfall voting power distribution discussed in the GLI forum post will be calculated. \n\n**Dispute Window:** The UAC will share the distribution results and provide a 3-day dispute window. \n\n**On-chain Vote:** Shortly following the closure of the dispute window, the UAC will publish the final on-chain proposal.",

      "title": "GLI \u2014 Incentivized Delegation Vaults",
      "body": "Background:\n\nBeginning in June, the UAC internally recognized votable supply, which at the time stood at ~41M UNI (relative to the 40M UNI quorum), as a potentially imminent and systemic risk to the DAO. In response, and in efforts to protect the DAO, the UAC proactively began the first Governance Logistics Improvement research report and RFC. The report sought to identify the greatest issues Uniswap governance faces, with particular emphasis on votable supply as it pertains to quorum\u2026\n\nTo address this mounting issue, the UAC invoked an open call for community-sourced solutions. This call resulted in five potential pathways, which were then aggregated and presented to the community. Of those five proposed solutions, two have emerged with majority support within the forum discussions: Treasury Delegations and Incentivized Delegation Vaults. (Governance Logistics Improvement)\n\nThis proposal addresses Incentivized Delegation Vaults.\n\nUAC Next Steps:\n\nUAC: \nWith regards to IDVs, the UAC will serve under the DAO\u2019s guidance as the program manager of the Incentivized Delegation Vault initiative, should it pass (detailed below).\n\nAuthor: Event Horizon\n\nProposal Summary:\nIncentivized Delegation Vaults: Multiple delegates recognized that it is not healthy for the governance ecosystem if the entirety of the votable supply is sustained by treasury delegations alone. As such, encouraging community delegations is essential. The most direct and intuitive approach is to incentivize participation. IDVs offer a low-touch, plug-and-play approach to facilitate this. Each eligible delegate will receive their own IDV. Delegators to each vault will receive emissions passively once delegated. The objective of IDVs is to, at a minimum, close the 9M UNI shortfall.\n![i1.png](ipfs://bafkreiegrgxwupgvee6eylc6toa3ndpyxrg3ypumcoxkbmayvai7cguui4)\n\n\nProposal Configuration:\n\nUnique Vaults for Every Delegate: \nEach eligible delegate will receive their own branded vault. Once created, these vaults will allow UNI token holders to earn reward emissions for delegating voting power to any branded delegate vault. No cost or obligations will be incurred by the delegates.\n\n\nEligibility: \nTreasury Delegation Candidates: Any delegate who qualifies for treasury delegations (regardless of whether they ultimately receive treasury delegations).\nDelegate Compensation Applicants: Any delegate who applied for the Delegate Reward Initiative cycle 4.\n\n\nApplication Process: \nThere will be an additional vault application thread where eligible applicants will be able to express their interest.\n\n\nUser Experience: \nIDVs simply track delegation activity on-chain, specifically who delegated to whom and how much, and emit weekly airdropped rewards to participants in exchange for delegating to eligible delegates. There is no transfer of assets, depositing or contract interactions necessary for claims.\n\nFlat Rate Emissions: \nA flat rate emission will be provided to depositors into any vault.\n\nEx. Assuming an APR of 2%, if there are 10 delegate vaults, with 1,000 UNI delegates across them in any distribution, each UNI delegated will earn 0.02 UNI per year, regardless of which vault it is held in.\n\nSecurity: \nTokens never leave the users\u2019 wallets. Delegation through IDVs is fully non-custodial. Users maintain complete control over their assets and are rewarded solely for delegating, not for transferring or locking tokens. Delegation is executed via a signature-based function call on the Uniswap token contract.\n\nStarting Program Configuration:\n\nTarget Delegations: 9,000,000 UNI\nStarting APR: 2%\n\n\nAPR Rationale: \nAssuming Treasury Delegations pass, the shortfall in delegated UNI is projected at ~9M UNI. At present, UNI has few, if any, single-sided, low-risk yield opportunities. A 2% APR is therefore considered sufficient to incentivize participation without excessive emissions.\nAt 2%, the one-year value of a single delegated UNI is 0.02 UNI per annum.\nNote: Because delegations will not materialize immediately at full scale, actual emissions may grow gradually, extending the budget\u2019s effective duration beyond one year.\n\n\nKPI: \nEmissions operate on a flat-rate model: every UNI emitted definitionally secures the exact amount of delegation value the DAO seeks. This design and commitment to flat vs variable APR eliminates the risk of \u201coverspend\u201d or \u201cunderspend\u201d: If more UNI is delegated, emissions scale up. If fewer UNI are delegated, fewer UNI are emitted. The sole KPI for program management is therefore to maintain an average APR at the DAO-approved target rate (e.g., 2%). This is achieved through straightforward accounting and strict adherence to the DAO mandate. In short, performance to emissions is guaranteed by design; the program succeeds whenever the agreed APR is consistently maintained.\n\n\nBudget: 18,200 UNI\n\n\nInitial Build: 5,000 UNI \u2013 A one-time allocation that covers the full build and instantiation of the product. This is released by the UAC at the point at which the product is functioning as noted by the launch of the first, or first batch, of delegate-branded IDVs.\n\n\nYear 1 Development and 2 Years of Maintenance: 13,200 UNI provides for one year of ongoing development and maintenance. Event Horizon will guarantee active development during the first 12 months. This may include, as reasonable, the incorporation of on-chain delegate metrics and requirements, integrations with approved third-party products, adjustments to the emissions model, and other DAO-requested improvements deemed beneficial. Event Horizon further commits to up to an additional 12 months of general product operation and maintenance beyond the 1-year payment term.\nNote: The Event Horizon team aims to serve as a transparent, consistent, and reliable builder for the Uniswap community alongside other recognized names, such as Oku, for years to come. In that spirit, we approached valuation in an effort to both allow for operational viability and continued future work/value provision for the DAO and to be respectful and reasonable in what we ask of the DAO. Our reasoning landed as follows:\n\nFrom the DAO\u2019s perspective, there is clear value in expanding the votable supply. This is abundantly evident by the current >$200m quorum deficit. But it also strengthens Uniswap\u2019s governance by reducing vulnerability and prevents future bottlenecks in decision-making.\n\nFrom the individual delegate\u2019s perspective, IDVs create tangible value by supporting their community involvement and in directly expanding their delegation through incentives.\n\nTo ground the valuation of governance participation, we looked at existing precedent: the delegate reward initiative. At current UNI prices, each compensated delegate receives ~600 UNI/month, while the average compensated delegate maintains ~1M UNI in delegations. In other words, consistent participation of ~1M UNI is currently valued by the DRI at ~600 UNI/month.\n\nThe IDV program is designed to mobilize up to 9M UNI. If even 10% of this target is reached (900K UNI), the mobilized voting power is equivalent to that of a compensated delegate presently valued at 600 UNI per month. At full capacity, IDVs nearly match the voting power of every compensated delegate combined, which currently represents a cumulative value of ~9,000 UNI per month.\n\nImportantly, this added voting power also improves the cost efficiency of the reward initiative itself, since every compensated delegate will be eligible for their own vault and therefore become the direct recipients of the delegations driven by IDVs. The same delegates, being paid the same amount from DRI, are now mobilizing a much more impactful benefit to the DAO.\n\nThe entire program\u2019s total cost nets to ~750 UNI/month, or approximately the cost of a single compensated delegate. This is factoring in not just mobilized voting power but also upfront build costs, benefits to individual delegates, and ongoing maintenance and evolution.\n\n\nTreasury Earmarked for Possible Emissions: 180,000 UNI\nThe UAC will custody 180,000 UNI for potential future emissions. This amount represents the maximum reserve required to support up to 9M UNI delegated for one year at a 2% APR.\n\n![i2.png](ipfs://bafkreig7g7uktz2ga5xprbzucoa7eiffujcejrjf3ftyi5zssx4llvlnme)\nProportional Scale\n\n![i3.png](ipfs://bafkreidfwegvhnglna5upvrrxu6qqwn2zlbmskdozq2dghnkh3qwulojhq)\nRe-Scaled\n\n\nKey points on Emissions:\n\n\nFlat-Rate Emissions: Each UNI emitted has a consistent marginal value. For example, at a 2% APR, every 1 UNI emitted secures 50 UNI in delegation for at least one year.\n\n\nNot a Committed Expense: The 180,000 UNI is an earmark, not a guaranteed outlay. Actual emissions will depend on delegation uptake, which is expected to ramp gradually rather than begin at full scale. The UAC only emits an amount of UNI directly proportional to the amount of value (in the form of delegations) that the delegates, and thereby the DAO, have gained through the vaults. As depicted above, it is a direct trade-off between delegations and UNI emissions at the exact value exchange rate determined and managed by the DAO.\n\n\nConservative Buffer: While it is unlikely the full 9M will be delegated immediately, holding the full earmark avoids the need for a risky \u201ctop-up\u201d proposal under sub-quorum conditions.\n\n\nNon-Dilutive: It is important to distinguish these emissions from other programs, such as LP incentives, in that the emissions are exclusively dedicated to UNI token holders. Any token holder who helps secure the DAO receives their share of emissions. As such, dilution is fully avoidable. And, contextualized at scale, even at its fullest emission rate, it represents ~0.034% in completely avoidable dilution annually.\n\nDAO Flexibility: Any unused portion remains in UAC custody and ultimately under DAO control, to be reallocated or repurposed as the community decides. \n\n(See Forum For Full Proposal\u2026)",

      "title": "GLI \u2014 Treasury delegation Round 2",
      "body": "Background:\n\nBeginning in June, the UAC internally recognized votable supply, which at the time stood at ~41M UNI (relative to the 40M UNI quorum), as a potentially imminent and systemic risk to the DAO. In response, and in efforts to protect the DAO, the UAC proactively began the first Governance Logistics Improvement research report and RFC. The report sought to identify the greatest issues Uniswap governance faces, with particular emphasis on votable supply as it pertains to quorum.\n\nNotably, the report emphasized that \u201cthe DAO operates under an unspoken dependency: that nearly all of its top delegates will participate in every vote, without exception. Put plainly, the exit of even a single large voter could bring governance to a standstill. Further, the risk of delegate removal from the voter body is not hypothetical; we\u2019ve already seen this dynamic unfold as several institutional actors have scaled back participation in response to regulatory pressures.\u201d\n\nIncidentally, during the initial weeks of research, that dependency risk became a material reality as changes in the token custody process led to A16Z\u2019s removal of ~20M UNI from delegation. As it stands today, the consistently active votable supply stands at just 21M UNI. This is just 52.5% of the required 40M UNI quorum, or approximately a $209 million vote deficit. While the UAC strongly believes that, for now, critical proposals will pass through the direct support of large, less active voters, such as A16Z, broader community governance risks grinding to a complete halt.\n\nTo address this mounting issue, the UAC invoked an open call for community-sourced solutions. This call resulted in five potential pathways, which were then aggregated and presented to the community. Of those five proposed solutions, two have emerged with majority support within the forum discussions: Treasury Delegations and Incentivized Delegation Vaults. (Governance Logistics Improvement)\n\nThis proposal addresses Treasury Delegations.\n\nUAC Next Steps:\n\nUAC: \nThe UAC has reviewed and endorsed the above research and RFC, as well as the conceptual solutions which the community generally agreed upon (Treasury Delegations + Incentivized Delegation Vaults). Given there is no counterparty to do so, the UAC will directly champion the push forward of the Treasury Delegations proposal and its implementation should it pass. With regards to IDVs, the UAC will serve under the DAO\u2019s guidance as the program manager of the Incentivized Delegation Vault initiative, should it pass (detailed below).\n\nAuthor: UAC ( Doo Wan Nam (@Doo_StableLab) | Jordan Karstadt (@DonOfDAOs) | @AbdullahUmar | PGov (@Juanbug) | @alicecorsini )\nCo-Author: Tane\n\n\nProposal Configuration:\n\n\nTemperature Checks: \nFollowing the posting of this proposal draft, the UAC will publish the TD temperature. Event Horizon will publish the IDV forum draft shortly, and eventually, the temperature check.\n\n\nOn-Chain Vote: \nShould TD pass, the UAC will publish the on-chain vote. Should IDVs pass, Event Horizon will publish the on-chain vote.\n\n\nProposal Summary: \nTreasury delegations have received nearly universal support, given their direct method of addressing the votable supply shortfall and proven historical precedent and track record. In fact, today, half of the remaining votable supply is directly sourced by the previous treasury delegation round (Governance Logistics Improvement) . The UAC recommends the following configuration:\n\nDelegation Amount: 10M UNI\nThis proposal will instantiate an additional 10M UNI in delegations from the treasury to community delegates. This will bring the resulting votable supply to ~31M UNI, or just ~25% below the required quorum.\n\nRelationship to Treasury Delegation Round 1: Additive\nThis round will not revoke, supersede, change, or otherwise impact the continuation of the 10M UNI previously delegated during the last treasury delegation round. As a result, the cumulative treasury delegated UNI will stand at 20M UNI.\n\nDelegation Cap: 2.5M\nTo avoid excessive consolidation of voting power, no round 2 applicant may accrue greater than 2.5M UNI in total voting power (be it from the treasury or otherwise) as a result of this round.\n\nEx. if an applicant holds 1M UNI in delegations, the most they stand to receive from this program is an additional 1.5M UNI in delegations. The remainder will waterfall to the next most eligible candidate.\n\n\nEligibility: Objective Metrics for Nomination + Election for Distribution\n\n\nApplication-based: Delegates will submit an application demonstrating their interest in being included in the treasury delegation round. The UAC will submit a forum post soliciting applications from eligible entities.\nEligibility to Apply:\nLook Back Window: 3 Months\nOn-chain Voting Participation: 75% minimum\nOff-chain Voting Participation: 75% minimum\nFinal Selection Process: Election\nThe DAO will vote for its preferred delegates from the pool of eligible candidates.\n\n\nTechnical Implementation: Franchiser\nAn identical approach to round one. A full review by Chainsecurity on the Franchiser contracts can be found here.\n\n\nDistribution Model: Waterfall\nEach eligible candidate will be listed on the election snapshot vote. The DAO will allocate voting power to each candidate as it sees fit. At the end of the voting period, all delegates will be ranked in order from the most to the least votes received. Sequentially from the top of the list to the bottom, each delegate will receive delegated voting power up to the point at which they individually hold 2.5M total VP. Then, the process repeats for the next delegate, and the next, until all VP has been allocated.\n\n\nSelf-Voting: Because this election is not for a finite number of seats, and it is best to encourage broader distribution of votes, self-voting will not leverage the max-matching model seen during committee elections. Instead, each voter will be eligible to commit a maximum of 25% to himself or herself and distribute the remainder as they see fit.\n\n\nSelected Delegates\u2019 Responsibilities:\nEach delegate elected by the DAO, who will receive the treasury delegation, should maintain the following requirements:\n\nMaintain a minimum 80% voting participation rate over the past 3 months.\nIncludes: both Snapshot and on-chain proposals\nExcludes: cancelled proposals\nMeasured from the date of Snapshot approval\n\n\nProgram Management:\nThe UAC will post a report every 3 months detailing the participation record of each delegation recipient, along with other relevant program information. Delegates who fail to meet the minimum participation requirements will have their delegations revoked via an on-chain voting. In the event of a revocation, the removed delegation will then be distributed in the same fashion as the initial waterfall design. The next highest scoring candidate will receive an increase in delegation up to the point at which they reach the 2.5M cap. If there is still voting power to distribute, it will then go to the next candidate. If all candidates have already met their 2.5M cap, the UAC will contact the first runner-up from the original election for inclusion into the program. If the first runner-up declines, cannot be contacted, or meets their 2.5M cap before the redelegated amount has been exhausted, the process continues sequentially through the following runner-ups.\n\n\nDelegate Principles: \nAll delegation recipients will be expected to review and uphold the delegate principles as ratified here: https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/78",

      "title": "Launching Uniswap v3 on Ronin with co-incentives",
      "body": "## Overview\n\nThis proposal advocates for an official UniswapV3 deployment on Ronin along with a co-incentivization campaign to establish UniswapV3 as a primary DEX in the Ronin Ecosystem.\n\nAll contracts necessary for Uniswap v3 deployment will be managed under Uniswap\u2019s governance control. To bootstrap liquidity, in combination with the migration of POL and chain-owned liquidity from the [Katana DEX](https://app.roninchain.com/swap) to Uniswap v3, Ronin proposes a $1M contribution in [RON](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ronin/) tokens, matched by $500K in UNI tokens from the Uniswap DAO.\n\nHistorically, Ronin has prioritized Katana DEX as its primary trading venue but is now shifting its focus towards making Uniswap v3 its canonical DEX.\n\nFurther details on the Ronin chain and its refreshed 2026 roadmap can be found in the RFC:\n[https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-deploying-uniswap-v3-on-ronin-with-co-incentives/25810 ](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-deploying-uniswap-v3-on-ronin-with-co-incentives/25810)\n\n---\n\n## Key Mutual Benefits of Deployment\n\n1. Ecosystem Expansion (Gaming x DeFi)\nBringing Uniswap v3 to Ronin strengthens the DeFi offering within the largest Web3 gaming ecosystem. Ronin is actively innovating on new game loops that plug directly into DeFi primitives to seamlessly onboard the millions of active gamers into DeFi.\n\n2. High Demand and Engagement\nWith 700K+ Discord members, 2,500+ content creators, and 300K newsletter subscribers, Ronin\u2019s hyper-engaged community presents fertile grounds for rapid liquidity bootstrapping.\n\n3. Bootstrapping Uniswap v3\nRonin looks to position Uniswap as the chain\u2019s primary trading hub. Sky Mavis is in-favor of migrating chain-owned liquidity, incentive provisions, and heavy marketing support.\n\n4. Historical Success with Uniswap\nIn 2021, prior to the launch of Ronin\u2019s homegrown Katana DEX, Ronin gaming tokens such as AXS and SLP had staggering trading volumes on Uniswap generating millions in LP fees while attracting over a million unique wallets to Uniswap.\n\n5. Access to Unique Assets\nRonin\u2019s unique edge is fostering the development of massive player-owned economies, With an average of 500K DAU across dozens of titles, Uniswap\u2019s v3 will be the trading hub of these game tokens.\n\n6. Aligned Incentives\nThe proposed matching structure ($1M in RON + $500K in UNI) ensures both parties share risk and reward, following proven co-incentive models used in previous network expansions.\n\n7. DeFi on Ronin\nAs the Ronin ecosystem opens its doors to DeFi, Uniswap v3 work in synergy with other blue chip dApps and platforms such as Compound Finance, Morpho, Merkl, Impossible Finance, Steer, and Liquity v2 - with more on the way.\n\n8. The DeFi Home of the Philippine Peso Stablecoin (PHPC)\nIn collaboration with [coins.ph](http://coins.ph), Ronin looks to position itself as the DeFi hub of PHPC. Multiple in-game integrations, lending market listings, incentivized DEX pools, and real-world payment integrations are in the works. Ronin will be the most exciting chain for PHPC token utility.\n\n---\n\n## Proposal Stakeholders\n\nProposer: Sky Mavis\n\nDeployer: GFX Labs\n\nBridge Provider: Wormhole\n\nTarget Chain: Ronin\n\nFront-end: Oku\n\nProposal Sponsor: PGov\n\n---\n\n## \u23f1 Proposal Plan / Timeline\n\n1. Request for Comment \u2013 1 week (22nd Aug 2025)\n2. Community Snapshot Check \u2013 Gauge community support in deploying Uniswap v3 on Ronin with $500k of UNI incentives to match Ronin\u2019s $1m commitment (Aug 2025)\n3. Deployment: GFX will deploy Uniswap v3 on Ronin on the Oku frontend (Sept 2025)\n4. On-chain Vote \u2013 If Snapshot passes, an on-chain proposal will be created (Aug 2025)\n5. Deployment & Incentive Distribution \u2013 Should the on-chain vote pass, we will work with the Accountability Committee to distribute the $500k if matched UNI and the Uniswap Growth Program to allocate the $1m of RON\n\n---\n\n## Incentive Plan\n\n* Uniswap DAO Match: 500K in UNI tokens distributed via liquidity mining over 6 months from the date of launch\n* Ronin Contribution: $1M in RON tokens\n* Monitoring Metrics: TVL, trading volume, LP retention, wallet activity \u2014 tracked via public Dune dashboards and posted monthly on the [UEII thread](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-ecosystems-incentives-initiative-ueii-update-thread/24959).\n* UNI Incentive Allocations: 75% of the 500K in UNI tokens will be distributed to token pairs that include BTC, ETH, Stablecoins, and their derivatives. 25% of UNI incentives will be allocated to top-performing gaming token pools. This ensures that depth is created for blue chip asset pairs, while simultaneously strengthening trading experiences for gamers and speculators.\n\nWe will work with the Uniswap Growth Program to iterate on distribution details as the program progresses, collaborating with necessary partners like Merkl and various ALMs.\n\n---\n\n## Governance and Oversight\n\nDeployment oversight will be managed by the Uniswap Accountability Committee, along with escrow of DAO-owned funds intended for incentivization purposes.\n\nThe incentives proposal is being presented to the DAO prior to the deployment of the v3 contracts by the Oku team due to strategic timing purposes. Ronin would like to align efforts around marketing the v3 deployment with simultaneous incentive opportunities for LPs via the Ronin\u2019s DeFi Blitz incentive program.\n\nHaving $UNI and $RON incentives live at the same time as the v3 contract deployment will send a strong signal of unity to the community and supercharge the incentive program to bootstrap the Uniswap v3 pools with greater efficacy.\n\nIf this incentives proposal were to fail, the v3 deployment will still take place, however, incentive allocation on the Ronin side will not be guaranteed.",

      "title": "Establish Uniswap Governance as \u201cDUNI,\u201d a Wyoming DUNA",
      "body": "# Summary\nThe Uniswap Foundation (\u201cUF\u201d) proposes that Uniswap Governance adopt a Wyoming-registered Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (\u201cDUNA\u201d) as the legal structure for the Uniswap Governance Protocol. This new legal entity, called \u201cDUNI\u201d, will be purpose-built to preserve Uniswap\u2019s decentralized governance structure while enabling engagement with the offchain world (e.g., entering into contracts, retaining service providers, and fulfilling any potential regulatory and tax responsibilities).\n\nIf adopted, DUNI will be a legal entity for Uniswap Governance that recognizes the binding validity of onchain Governance Proposals with the intention of providing certainty regarding its legal structure and intended liability protections for members of DUNI. Adopting DUNI does not, in any way, alter the Uniswap Protocol, the UNI token, or the core mechanics of onchain governance. Rather, it represents a significant step in equipping Uniswap Governance for the future.\n\nImportantly, establishing Uniswap Governance as a DUNA would bolster critical limited liability protections for governance participants. This step is intended to protect governance participants from potential personal exposure to possible legal or tax liabilities stemming from the collective action taken by Uniswap Governance. This is a critical step in de-risking engagement in Uniswap Governance without compromising decentralization.\n\n# Background & Motivation\nIn the [Uniswap Unleashed](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-uniswap-unleashed/25251) roadmap, we described a vision for evolving Uniswap Governance. In this vision, Governance can turn on the protocol fee, fund innovation, form partnerships, and navigate legal obligations with confidence. While onchain governance is integral to Uniswap\u2019s credible neutrality, it has historically lacked the corresponding infrastructure for basic offchain coordination and formalized protection for its collective actions. To execute on our vision, we need something more.\n\nTo that end, over the past two years, the Uniswap Foundation has explored options for establishing a legal structure that is intended to:\n\n- Provide more clarity regarding liability protection for Uniswap Governance participants;\n- Maintain the primary authority of the Uniswap Governance protocol; and\n- Enable execution of offchain operations without introducing centralized points of control.\n\nAfter significant research, legal consultation, and community engagement, the [Wyoming DUNA](https://www.wyoleg.gov/2024/Introduced/SF0050.pdf) (passed into law in 2024) emerged as a credibly neutral and transparent option. It has been explicitly designed for decentralized protocol governance systems to gain legal legitimacy without compromising their core ethos.\n\nIn our research, we have worked closely with a firm called [Cowrie](https://cowrie.io/articles/announcement), founded by David Kerr. Based in Cheyenne, Wyoming, Cowrie is composed of a team of regulatory and technical experts that provides legal, financial, and administrative support to decentralized protocols. David was instrumental in writing Wyoming\u2019s DUNA statute, and has worked directly with legislators to educate them on the intricacies of the DUNA, what it enables DAOs to accomplish, what DAOs are, why decentralization is important, etc. Cowrie\u2019s role in the context of DUNI is to act as an Administrator of DUNI - facilitating regulatory and tax compliance, tax filings, informational reporting, and operational infrastructure within the constructs of its authorizations.\n\n# Specification\nIf this proposal passes, the resulting onchain transaction will adopt a DUNA for Uniswap Governance. Specifically, it will:\n\n- Ratify the DUNA\u2019s Association Agreement establishing the rules of DUNI;\n- Execute a Ministerial Agent Agreement with the Uniswap Foundation; and\n- Execute an Administrator Agreement with Cowrie - Administrator Services; This includes the execution of a separate Administrator Agreement with David Kerr (CEO of Cowrie) for specific authorizations.\n\nAdditionally, the transaction will execute two transfers of UNI from the treasury, specifically:\n\n- $16.5m worth of UNI to a DUNI-owned wallet to prefund a legal defense budget and a tax compliance budget;\n- $75k worth of UNI to Cowrie for their services as compliance administrator.\n\nAll supporting documentation can be found on the UF's website [here](https://www.uniswapfoundation.org/duni).",

Please check on the forum for the background.*\n...\nThe significant change for Cycle 3 is an introduction of Delegate owned UNI token to reflect on requests from several Uniswap DAO members during the Cycle 3 debate (the debate on this topic) for experimentation. For this cycle, the basis will be 1,000 UNI token (<$10k of August 2nd price). Delegates who hold 1,000 UNI or more would be able to get a small additional point on the application and will be the basis for getting 100% of the Uniswap Delegate reward once accepted. Details on how UNI ownership is determined is explained below in \u201cUniswap Delegate Reward Cycle 4 Metrics.\u201d We believe experimenting with such can potentially address the question of delegates having more \u201cskin in the game.\u201d\n\n...\n\nCycle 4 Proposal Details\nApplication Eligibility\n\nThere will be a week-long period for candidates to submit their applications. The top 15 delegates will be determined based on a point system outlined below.\n\nDelegates from Cycle 3 must apply again for Cycle 4\u2013they will not be automatically included.\n\nOnly delegates who have participated in onchain voting for at least three months prior to the application post are eligible for Cycle 4.\n\nUniswap Delegate Reward Cycle 4 Metrics\nIn case there are more than 15 eligible applicants, the top 15 will be chosen by the following objective metrics. The highest number of available points will be 13.\n\nThere will only be one wallet used for tracking for such metrics unless a Delegate has communicated on their delegate platform on the forum that the voting address will be changed at the time of change. In case of if the Delegate did not communicate such change on the delegate platform on the forum, the Delegate applicant can only choose one wallet to be used for evaluating for the metrics.\n\nApplicants will also need to agree to follow Principles for Uniswap DAOto be eligible.\n\n1. Voting Participation\n\nSince a delegate\u2019s primary role is to utilize voting power from delegators and vote in Uniswap\u2019s best interest, active participation is essential to ensuring quorums are met and malicious proposals are thwarted. This category carries a total of 7 points, with onchain voting weighted more heavily due to its ability to directly impact governance contracts and direct treasury funds. The voting rate is evaluated based on the past six months.\n\nOffchain Voting (Snapshot)\n\n90% and above: 3\n80% to 90% : 2\n70% till 80% : 1.5\n60% till 70%: 1\n50% till 60%: 0.5\n50% or below: 0\n\nOnchain Voting\n\n90% and above : 4\n80% till 90% : 2.5\n70% till 80%: 1.5\n60% till 70%: 1\n50% till 60%: 0.5\nBelow 50%: 0\n\n2. Proposal Authorship\n\nContributing to proposal drafting for Uniswap DAO is valuable, but maintaining quality and preventing malicious proposals is equally important. As a result, only successfully passed votes are counted. This category is worth a total of 3 points, with onchain proposals receiving greater weight once again.\n\nFor non-binary proposals, if a \u201cNo\u201d equivalent option was available and the final voting outcome was a choice other than \u201cNo,\u201d the proposal qualifies for points in this category. For example, the Uniswap Treasury Working Group (UTWG) Election would not be eligible, as there was no \u201cNo\u201d vote option. However, the [Temp] Uni Onboarding Package - BSC would qualify, since an \u201cAgainst\u201d option was present, and the final outcome was \u201c$1M.\u201d\n\nOnly the sole author or co-authors explicitly mentioned on the proposal will receive credit.\n\nAuthored or Co-authored a proposal that passed offchain (Snapshot) vote before.\n\nYes, 2 or more: 1\nYes, 1: 0.5\nNo: 0\n\nAuthored or Co authored a proposal that passed onchain vote before\n\nYes, 2 or more: 2\nYes, 1: 1\nNo: 0\n\n3. Community Participation\n\nThe full point for this category is 1.\n\nCommunity Calls (March - August 2025)\n\nAttended at least 80% of calls: 1\nAttended at least 50% of calls: 0.5\n\nAttended less than 50% of calls: 0\n\n4. Delegate Owned UNI Token\n\nThe full point for this category is 1.\n\nBlockchain signatures are required so Delegate can prove that Delegate has ownership of UNI Token. In addition, UNI token delegate claims to own must be delegated to the applicant delegate. One needs to have 1,000 UNI or more and have blockchain signature that verifies ownership from the wallet that holds 1,000 UNI or more by the time the applicant applies to gain extra 1 point in applications.\n\nEx) If StableLab wants to receive full point for this category, StableLab needs to hold at least 1,000 UNI, share in the application the wallet address where 1,000 UNI is being held, sign blockchain signature that confirms that the wallet belongs to StableLab and from that wallet address must delegate to StableLab.\n\nTo qualify for this 1 point, the delegated owned 1,000 UNI must remain at least until the verification process is completed and the application results are announced.\n\nDelegate owns 1,000 UNI and is delegated to Delegate applying\n\nYes: 1\n\nNo: 0\n\n5. Perfect Participation\n\nThe full point for this category is 1.\n\nDelegates with participation over the past 6 months: Voted in 100% of the proposals (both on Snapshot and on-chain), submitted rationale for 100% of their votes in time (7 days from the end of each vote), attended 100% of the community calls.\n\nYes: 1\n\nNo: 0\n\nTie Breaker\n\nTies will be decided by the date of the first onchain vote that these applicants cast in order to reward delegates who have been contributing to Uniswap governance for an extended period. The tie-breaking value will be determined based on the end date of the vote in which the delegates participated, not the onchain date when the vote was cast.\n\nIn the event of a tie with the first tie-breaker criterion, priority will be given to the delegate who has cast the most votes in the last 6 months.\n\nIn the event that the tie persists further, the final decision will favor the delegate who was first to present their delegation platform\u2014hence, priority will be given to the individual/entity who first publicly declared their intention to become a delegate.\n\nDelegate Reward Eligibility\n\nOnce delegates have passed the application process, they must fulfill the following requirements to be eligible for up to $6,000 USD worth of $UNI reward per month.\n\nRequirements\n\nMaintain a minimum of 80% participation in onchain and off-chain voting during the last 3 months to be eligible to receive up to $3,000 worth of $UNI per month, with the proportional payment based on each delegate\u2019s participation in the total votes cast during the last 3 months (number of votes cast x 100 / total votes cast during the last 3 months). For example, if there were 10 votes cast in the last 3 months and a delegate voted on 8 of them, that delegate will receive 80% of the $3,000 USD, i.e. the delegate will be eligible to receive $2,400. If another delegate voted on 7 of those votes, that delegate will not be eligible to receive any rewards as their participation was 70% of the votes, below the 80% minimum.\nAdditional Rewards (the below are only available if the above Requirement of Voting Participation is fulfilled)\n\n2a. Write rationale for the voting on their delegate profile.\n-Deadline for writing rationale would be 7 days from the end of each vote.\n2b. Attend Uniswap Community Calls.\n\n2c. Maintain ownership of 1,000 UNI or more and delegated to the Delegate\n\nAchieving these above will provide an additional up to $3,000 USD worth of $UNI. 2c must be met, meaning ownership of 1,000 or more UNI must be maintained and delegated to the delegate to be eligible. If 2c is met, for 2a, 2b, there will also be proportional payment. For example, if 2c is met, and if there were 4 votings and 1 community call, and a delegate missed writing a rationale of 2 of the votes, the delegate would be eligible to receive $1800 [3/5 * $3000].\n\nRegarding 2c, once again, in case of less than 1,000 UNI, This proportion will NOT be applied. For example, even if a Delegate has 500 UNI and fulfill all of 2a and 2b, the additional rewards would be $0 worth of UNI. The Uniswap Accountability Committee will periodically check qualified Delegates\u2019 wallets for their UNI amount.\n\nBudget\n\nWe are requesting 540,000 [6000 USD *6 Months *15 Delegates ] USD worth of UNI for cycle 4 of the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative.\n\nThe total amount, once approved, will be sent to the Accountability Committee, which will be responsible for the monthly distribution of rewards to eligible delegates. Since the total budget of the Delegate Reward WG has not been fully used, administration of this reward program\u2013including the creation of this proposal and the admin work behind verifying monthly delegate participation\u2013will be allotted from that account, with no additional costs to the DAO. Therefore, the total budget request will be solely for the delegate pay.",

      "title": "[TEMP CHECK] - Etherlink Co-incentives Proposal",
      "body": "## TL;DR:\n\n**Etherlink**, an EVM-compatible Layer 2 blockchain secured by Tezos Smart Rollup technology, proposes a co-incentive program to bootstrap liquidity on Uniswap v3. The **Tezos Foundation commits $300K** to incentivize strategic pools and requests a **$150K co-incentive** from the Uniswap DAO. This initiative will drive long-term liquidity, support ecosystem growth, and position Uniswap as the default AMM for uncorrelated asset pairs on Etherlink.\n\n## About Etherlink\n\nEtherlink is an EVM-compatible, non-custodial Layer 2 blockchain powered by Tezos Smart Rollup technology. It enables seamless integration with existing Ethereum tools, including wallets and indexers, and facilitates asset transfers to and from other EVM-compatible chains.\n\nBuilt upon the secure foundation of Tezos Layer 1, Etherlink delivers a fast, fair, and (nearly) free experience. Developed by the same core teams behind Tezos and fully supported by the Tezos Foundation, Etherlink offers a permissionless and censorship-resistant environment that empowers developers to actively build and participate in the next generation of decentralized applications.\n\nOfficially launched in early 2025, Etherlink has seen strong TVL growth \\- rising from approximately $1.5 million to \\~$45 million within a few months \\- driven primarily by the Apple Farm incentive program. With the launch of Season 2 and the onboarding of new protocols, we expect this growth to continue, targeting a minimum of $100 million in TVL by the end of the year.\n\nEtherlink is developing its ecosystem by onboarding new categories of assets such as Physical Uranium; Treasury bills and DeFi strategies tokenized by [Midas](https://midas.app/); licensed on-chain money market funds; and is looking to onboard new permissionless RWA tokens.   \n   \nThe goal is to establish Uniswap as the primary AMM for uncorrelated asset pairs on Etherlink. All future Tezos Foundation\u2013supported project tokens \\- particularly in Gaming and Art \\- will deploy their primary liquidity pools on Uniswap. The Foundation is currently in the process of investing in several strategic projects within the Etherlink ecosystem, which will result in new tokens launching in the coming months. These tokens will be paired on Uniswap from day one, further cementing its role as the default venue for liquidity.\n\n### Apple Farm\n\n[Apple Farm](https://app.applefarm.xyz/) is an incentive program \\- powered by Merkl \\- designed to bootstrap DeFi on Etherlink by rewarding users who provide liquidity on DEXs, supply capital on lending markets, and trade on selected DeFi protocols. In season one, the participating protocols are Superlend, Hanji, Uniswap, IguanaDEX, & [Uranium.io](http://Uranium.io).\n\nAs the first AMM deployed on Etherlink (a PancakeSwap v3 fork), IguanaDEX saw significant growth in both trading volume and TVL, largely driven by incentives from Apple Farm.\n\nSince Thursday, June 19th and through July 3rd, [incentives](https://app.applefarm.xyz/protocols/uniswap?status=LIVE%2CSOON%2CPAST) are already being distributed to initial Uniswap v3 pools as part of Apple Farm Season 1\\. A total of $37,500 in rewards (not included in this proposal) will be allocated during this period, marking the beginning of Uniswap\u2019s long-term role in Etherlink\u2019s DeFi stack. The Etherlink team is coordinating with the Uniswap Growth Program on this proposal and will transparently share the terms and outcomes of the Season 1 distribution with the DAO.\n\nIn Season 2 \\- running approximately from July 15th to October 25th \\- at least $300K in incentives will be allocated to core blue-chip pairs, especially WETH/USDC, WBTC/USDC, and LBTC/USDC.\n\nUniswap will become the primary liquidity venue for all uncorrelated and ecosystem-native tokens, while IguanaDEX will continue to specialize in efficient stablecoin trading using its stableswap bonding curve.\n\n## Etherlink and Uniswap\n\nProposed Plan:\n\nEtherlink and the Tezos Foundation are committed to allocating a minimum of $300K in incentives to Uniswap pools over 3 months \\- starting mid-July \\- as part of Apple Farm season two. \n\n**We propose a co-incentive of $150K from the Uniswap DAO to further enhance liquidity and foster a collaborative growth environment. The Tezos Foundation will also provide initial liquidity in each pool to facilitate efficient deployment and trading.**\n\nProposed incentive distribution\n\n1. WETH/USDC \\- \u2153   \n2. LBTC/USDC \\- \u2153  \n3. WBTC/USDC \\- \u2153\n\nWhile the $300k allotment provided by the Tezos Foundation and the $UNI rewards will follow this distribution, the Etherlink team may choose to allocate additional incentives to blue chip/XTZ pairs in the future over the course of Apple Farm Season 2\\. \n\n### **Uniswap TVL Analysis (Jul 6 2025\\)**\n\n* Uniswap V3 TVL on Etherlink: $2.5M,\n\n* Current Pools on Uniswap \\- Etherlink: [https://oku.trade/info/etherlink/overview](https://oku.trade/info/etherlink/overview)\n\n\nUniswap is already [deployed on Etherlink](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-etherlink-canonical-uniswap-v3-deployment/25659). \n\nBy collaborating with the Uniswap DAO, Etherlink aims to strengthen its DeFi ecosystem and provide mutual benefits to both platforms.

The launch of USDS and sUSDS opens doors for close collaboration among two of the premier DeFi protocols Uniswap and Sky Ecosystem.\n\nFollowing the launch of USDS and sUSDS on Unichain, this proposal aims to boost growth on Unichain through a combination of partnerships and matched incentives, driven by aligned KPIs related to USDS and sUSDS growth on Unichain.\n\nMotivation\n\nUnichain is currently growing almost exclusively in Uniswap pools. Growth in other DeFi protocols on Unichain is growing but still behind. The introduction of USDS and sUSDS creates opportunities for enhanced collaboration among DeFi protocols.\n\nsUSDS provides yield, which itself is paid for by the Sky ecosystem. For example, if Unichain sUSDS TVL grows to 100 million, and at the current 4.5% of sUSDS yield, that would cost Sky 4.5 million USD per year. sUSDS can be a crucial part of the growth of the Unichain DeFi ecosystem, as it allows a stable and scalable yield source. For example, just examining Euler, removing Euler\u2019s extra incentive, the lending APY is 3.19% for USDC and 2.05% for USDT as of June 4th 2025. However, if Euler were to integrate sUSDS yield and also provide its own incentive on top of incentive from Unichain, it could make it much more competitive yield compared to all other chains.\n\n![AD_4nXdDAsTBvjSMYKLpQqYxma3UBpuhPVGBwQFv0jL56JSnRyOIaZuXc2_ix3QykUGYeJ-KMXu9aui5TjGr_fsoeeE1w2-YcfZLIGsnGj5YZ4N4uev90mJb6QANvKLSYmCdfx4qVk3Akw.png](ipfs://bafybeiazv2vbgksrttgluxpsfra6xno5c2lk3jvaw4pobl5zns3qautium)\nSource: DeFillama - Unichain May 16,2025\n\n\n![AD_4nXcAs0uY8jLQwOsEN4o7kTQfM_REhiSSyGBqDr43PW8x5l9qtk1laRm5dlVUGhY_KD5gGJZxXZ3WuXFBRG1LhvkD6NH6rp_3wuULi5zn3mDFRNiCnc12pQdfdk4TiSr8N7t6p_yrZA.png](ipfs://bafkreichinseh6jqs6f6devg5thnaph4hfktuu5gfomyxj5zweojf2t4pa)\nSource: DeFillama - Unichain June 4,2025\n\nIn addition, we strongly believe in Uniswap DAO having guidance and decision over the incentives distribution. Once per month, the strategy will be suggested to UniswapDAO where they can vote via snapshot to support the monthly incentive distribution or not.\n\nGoal / Growth Strategy\n\nThe strategy involves coordinating with key protocols to expand the Unichain ecosystem such as by utilizing Sky ecosystem\u2019s competitive base savings rate, which with the incentive from Uniswap DAO along with relevant DeFi partner can amplify it further. This can be done via three main ways:\n\nCollaboration with protocols to Increase TVL and Users\nStableLab will onboard protocols and, where applicable, negotiate co-incentive plans. For example, it could be that co-incentives are discussed with Euler and/or Compound to provide even additional incentives on top of sUSDS yield and co-incentives from Unichain.\n\nFocus on optimizing incentive programs\nAll co-incentive programs will be data-driven to ensure effective growth. Co-incentives will be spent with strategic reasoning and analytical support. The program update will be shared once per month to communicate with the community.\n\nContinuous improvement and optimization\nIn addition to the monthly program updates, we\u2019ll refine the strategy in real-time, allowing for continuous improvement and optimization. KPI-driven growth will enable ongoing adjustment of both partnership targets and co-incentives distribution to ensure maximum ROI on spending.\n\nBudget and Duration\n\nAs mentioned above, sUSDS provides yield, paid for by the Sky ecosystem. For example, if sUSDS grows to 100 million, at the current yield rate of 4.5%, that would cost Sky 4.5 million USD cost per year. And various DeFi protocols\u2019 contributions would be added to further grow Unichain.\n\nWe believe in Uniswap DAO having guidance and decision over the incentives distribution. Once per month, the strategy will be suggested to UniswapDAO where they can vote via snapshot to support the monthly incentive distribution or not.\n\nWe also strongly believe the majority of the budget that Uniswap DAO provides should be tied to objective KPIs like USDS and sUSDS supply on Unichain, which is inherently tied to TVL on Unichain.\n\nTherefore, we propose a $1,000,000 USD budget over the course of a year with an additional $3,000,000 USD based on KPIs. In other words, only one fourth of the budget will be fixed, while the remaining part will be performance-based. The initial fixed payment will be paid in monthly installments while the performance based part will be paid at a time when the agreed upon KPIs are reached and we request the unlock by submitting on-chain proof.\n\nIn addition, 80% of the budget will be directly spent on co-incentives that focus on USDS and sUSDS growth to boost Unichain TVL and usage. For instance, additional yield for sUSDS to make sUSDS yield on Unichain more attractive or an incentivized USDS and/or sUSDS pool such as UNI-USDS on Unichain.\n\nThe remaining 20% of the budget, would be used for operations and logistics - such as coordinating with partners and also optimizing and reporting on the incentive program\n\nKPIs\n\nKPIs are intentionally set high to align with the DAO\u2019s interests. Currently stablecoin market in Unichain is 279.4 million, with around 60% being USDC. The aim is to grow USDS / sUSDS to at least 100 million, which will help to increase Stablecoin market by close to 35%.\n\n![AD_4nXeJ32UaElVjEX1N_mfsNV0gF4m_l5USrLuSzNwhVWfIp3XT0IV1y2nKDtSvRtPnueHtiFZhVoLYN_aMgFY3uPM4wyTjG8xVftZwakiYcWB7OpL2ng_YHvQ2we7kYWLk981jO63B.png](ipfs://bafkreihuhhraeo73eeyi6vcbahay2x35vrejngxfewb4tdcrj2grtgcztq)\nSource: DeFillama - Unichain June 4,2025\n\nOut of $3,000,000 USD potential incentive based payment:\n\nUSDS and sUSDS combined supply grow its TVL above 20 million USD on Unichain\n$1,000,000 USD Unlock. 80% will be used for co-incentives.\n\nUSDS and sUSDS combined supply grow its TVL above 50 million USD on Unichain\nAdditional $1,000,000 USD Unlock. 80% will be used for co-incentives.\n\nUSDS and sUSDS combined supply grow its TVL above 100 million USD on Unichain\n-Additional $1,000,000 USD Unlock. 80% will be used for co-incentives.

      "title": "Trial run a Technical Advisory Board (TAB)",
      "body": "# Summary\nThis proposal seeks to establish a Technical Advisory Board (TAB) within the Uniswap DAO for a 12-month trial to provide expert technical insights on governance proposals. The TAB will be supported by a Professional Delegate (PD) to facilitate operations and communication. A total of 2.5 million UNI tokens will be delegated to expiring Franchiser contracts to empower the TAB\u2019s governance participation.\n\n# Motivation\nThe Uniswap DAO governs the protocol\u2019s evolution but often lacks consistent technical expertise. While some delegates offer valuable insights, few possess deep technical knowledge of Uniswap\u2019s codebase or ecosystem dynamics (e.g., partnerships, integrations, routers, aggregators). Developers and builders, who have direct experience, often find the governance process opaque or inaccessible, limiting their ability to contribute meaningfully.\n\nConversations with Uniswap ecosystem teams revealed that developers want to provide input but need a structured pathway. They believe their expertise could enhance proposals by assessing technical feasibility, estimating timelines, identifying risks, and evaluating costs. Improved governance participation would align ecosystem upgrades with builders\u2019 needs.\n\nThe TAB aims to bridge this gap by offering structured technical guidance, improving proposal quality, mitigating risks, and strengthening Uniswap\u2019s decentralized governance. It will provide a clear pathway for builders to engage, fostering inclusivity and technical rigor.\n\n# Background\nTechnical expertise is critical for effective protocol governance but is underrepresented in Uniswap DAO. Inspired by Optimism\u2019s Developer Advisory Board, we propose a TAB tailored to Uniswap\u2019s governance model and market position.\n\nKey findings from research and interviews with builders include:\n- Developers want governance roles but need structured engagement.\n- Proposals often lack technical feasibility assessments, causing inefficiencies.\n- Builders can offer critical feedback on risks, timelines, and ecosystem impact.\n- A dedicated advisory group would enhance transparency and sustainability.\n\nThe TAB will deliver expert evaluations, working with a Professional Delegate to integrate insights into governance. This structure aims to foster a more inclusive, technically sound governance process for Uniswap\u2019s growth.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Technical Advisory Board (TAB)\n#### Composition\nThe TAB will consist of 6 seasoned professionals with expertise in smart contracts, Uniswap\u2019s protocol, and related fields (e.g., builders, security researchers). Its diversity and commitment to comprehensive support will ensure informed governance decisions.\n\nThis structure addresses the lack of technical expertise in governance, inspired by Optimism\u2019s model but adapted for Uniswap. The TAB balances technical evaluation with community education to improve proposal quality and transparency while preserving DAO control through iterative feedback.\n\n**Proposed TAB Members** (based on Uniswap Foundation and ecosystem feedback):\n1. **Akshat Mittal** - Senior Protocol Engineer at Reserve, Founder of Metacrypt. 10+ years in technology, 6 in Web3, with deep DeFi expertise in protocol design.\n2. **Alex Netto** - Founder/CEO at Blockful, focused on DAO security and governance. Experienced in smart contracts, Uniswap V4 hackathon winner, ENS metagov steward.\n3. **Ben DiFrancesco** - Founder/CEO at ScopeLift, contributor to Uniswap smart contracts, with expertise in EVM and DAO governance engineering.\n4. **Dakotah Moses** - Growth lead at Bunni, a Uniswap V4-native DEX. Bridges engineering and strategy to drive adoption.\n5. **Haardik H** - 7+ years as a developer/consultant in DeFi, Identity, and Privacy. Built technical education programs at LearnWeb3 and Atrium Academy.\n6. **Kris O\u2019Shea** - Blockchain developer at Olas Protocol, former Sumero Finance developer. Uniswap ambassador, V4 hackathon winner, co-authored V4 documentation.\n\n#### Responsibilities\n- Analyze all governance proposals from inception, evaluating the feasibility and impact of proposals which are technical in nature throughout the voting process, while providing timely and insightful feedback.\n- Proactively identify and address potential risks or unintended consequences within proposal design\n- Vote on all proposals during the 12-month term and provide a brief overview of the TAB\u2019s rationale.\n- Translate complex technical concepts into clear and accessible language for non-technical delegates.\n- Develop educational resources and explanations to enhance understanding of proposal implications.

The maximum self-voting % allowed is 50%, and this amount must be at least evenly distributed among other candidates. The maximum self-vote percentage in any scenario must be matched equally with at least one other candidate.\n  - Example: if you self-vote with 50% of your voting power, you must give one more candidate the other 50% (max matching 50%). If you self-vote with 25% of your voting power, you may divide the remaining 75% among as many candidates as you like, as long as one other candidate also receives 25% (max matching 25%). The self-vote % is simply your own voting cap that must be matched at least once with another applicant.\n- This setup introduces a cap to self-voting, while simultaneously giving a degree of priority to yourself, as we understand that you would not be applying if you didn\u2019t feel like a qualified candidate. This is something that was \u201csoft consensus\u201d decided when some issues arose with the treasury working group vote a few months ago.\n\nEligibility Criteria\nAs specified on the forums, you are only allowed to apply as an individual\u2014not as an organization, using your DAO-recognized name and identity.

However, after discussing with various Uniswap DAO participants, as the Unichain incentives program is still ongoing, it was communicated that it would be beneficial to assess other chains that went through the incentive program first before revisiting Unichain assessment.\n\nWhat is Forse?\n\nForse, built by StableLab, is a data and intelligence platform designed to help blockchains and DeFi protocols measure, analyze, and optimize their growth and operational efficiency. By integrating onchain user and network metrics with offchain data, Forse provides actionable insights that drive more thoughtful decision-making and showcase the tangible benefits of the Unichain ecosystem.\n\nWith deep expertise in protocol operations and DAO governance, Forse will allow Unichain stakeholders to make data-backed strategic decisions. Our dashboards and analytics solutions enhance transparency, measure the impact of initiatives, and demonstrate Unichain\u2019s competitive advantages.\n\nWe work closely with protocol teams to understand their unique objectives and tailor our analyses using extensive datasets. Our experience with leading DAOs, including Sky (FKA MakerDAO), Arbitrum, Optimism, and Uniswap, positions Forse as the ideal partner for delivering a robust, data-driven analytics solution customized for Unichain.\n\nTeam\n\nDr. Christian Ziegler is the CTO at StableLab. Previously, he worked as a researcher at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where he wrote his doctoral thesis on DAOs. In 2018, he co-founded Blockcurators GmbH. Christian has several published scientific articles, including a Taxonomy of DAOs; scoring methodologies for DAOs; network analysis of DAOs; and classification of DAO proposals using LLMs; among others.\n\nJohannes Loewe is the Data Lead at StableLab, where he focuses on all stages of AI and ML development, from experimentation to deployment. Before joining StableLab, he was a Freelance AI & Blockchain Software Engineer. He also has experience with DAOs, being a founding member of PretzelDAO in Munich. He holds a Bachelor\u2019s degree from Radboud University in the Netherlands and a Master\u2019s degree in Machine Learning from NUI-Galway in Ireland.\n\nMarcos Miranda is the Head of Product at StableLab. With 6 years of experience in Product Management, focusing on Web3 and Analytics products, he is also experienced in building DeFi protocols, having previously worked for other protocols in the space.\n\nMethods\n\nBuilding upon the frameworks used in the original analysis, this proposal extends the same level of detail and transparency across four additional chains. As before, our methodology combines statistical modeling, user segmentation, and performance benchmarking ensuring the surfaced insights are valuable to the DAO.\n\nOur methods will include:\n\nTime-series data analysis across key protocol metrics, such as TVL, volume, Liquidity Provision, and Activity.\nDifference-in-Differences modeling to highlight causal impact of incentives on key protocol metrics.\nCohort Analysis of LPs and general users, with different segmentations based on, pool type usage, and general behavior.\nEfficiency Metrics to track TVL and Volume per dollar of incentives spent, with pool based segmentations.\nUser Acquisition Cost, retention and stickiness indicators to analyze long-term impact of incentives on the aforementioned segmentations .\nRewards flow mapping to visualize post-incentive asset movements and claim, held, and sold behaviors.\nSpecification\n\nThe insights and graphs produced as a result of this analysis will be displayed in the already existent Uniswap Incentives terminal, alongside the outcomes of our previous work, effectively creating an analytics hub showcasing:\n\nIncentive ROI and impact quantification in terms of TVL and Volume generated per dollar of incentives.\nUser Segmentation and retention analysis, enabling the understanding of different user types, their acquisition cost and likelihood to remain in the ecosystem..\nCampaign Efficiency Analysis, visually representing comparisons on the best cost-to-growth performance across pools and chains.\nBenchmark and Comparative Analysis, featuring comparisons in terms of performance and growth with other relevant ecosystems and protocols.\nFlow Analysis on Rewards, highlighting behaviours and destination of rewards.\nWe believe extending our analysis into 4 additional chains will provide Key Uniswap Stakeholders with a more comprehensive view of how incentives are performing to further optimize for the future initiatives. To see Forse in action, explore our interactive terminal showcasing our previous analysis of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program for Arbitrum, Base, Blast, and Scroll.\n\nBudget Request\n\nThe proposal requests $60,000 worth of UNI to analyze the further impact of the the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program to analytics modules utilized in the interactive terminal. The dashboard will aim to be delivered by the end of Q2 of 2025. Forse will receive the budget only once the terminal is delivered, similar to the past analysis to ensure accountability to Uniswap DAO.",

      "title": "[TEMP CHECK] Scaling V4 and Supporting Unichain",
      "body": "# Scaling V4 and Supporting Unichain\nGFX Labs proposes that the Uniswap DAO allocate funding to support the integration of Uniswap V4 on Ethereum in Oku, grant GFX Labs a blanket license exemption for future V4 deployments, and to add support for Unichain on Oku. This initiative aims to enhance Uniswap's reach, encourage liquidity migration to V4, and solidify the protocol\u2019s position as the leading decentralized exchange.\n\n### Background\n\nIn 2022, GFX Labs was granted $1.6M from the Uniswap DAO to scale the Uniswap ecosystem and expand the protocol's presence across EVM chains. Today, Oku is live across 30+ chains, and we have expanded our services to offer best-in-class bridge and trade aggregation. With a dedicated interface for V3 pool analytics and a simplified LP management interface, Oku has served as a consistent and scalable growth channel for the wider Uniswap ecosystem.\n\nWe\u2019ve deployed to a wide range of chains at our own expense \u2013 far exceeding the original scope of the grant \u2013 and have generated a high ROI by accelerating Uniswap adoption across new environments. Now, with the advent of Uniswap V4, it\u2019s time to build the next generation of tooling for the next wave of liquidity.\n\n### Scale V4 and Add Unichain Support\n\nSince the launch of Uniswap V4 in January 2025, we\u2019ve seen a surge in interest from users, partners, and hook developers eager to experiment with the new protocol\u2019s capabilities. As one of the most active contributors to the Uniswap ecosystem infrastructure, GFX Labs views this momentum as a timely opportunity to scale V4 usage, reduce friction for LP\u2019ing, and host an environment for hook developers to showcase their innovative pool adaptations. As we have provided for V3, GFX Labs will develop a dedicated V4 analytics interface to support hooked pool discovery and performance tracking.\n\n### Who benefits?\n\nThe Uniswap DAO\u2019s ability to expand V4\u2019s reach heavily depends on ecosystem builders and infrastructure. That is why supporting the flywheel between hook builders, liquidity migrators/providers, and traders is crucial. With V4\u2019s flexibility also comes complexity. It is key that each stakeholder's user experience and needs are addressed and iterated upon so V4 can become the dominant DEX protocol. Oku will fill the gaps and support ecosystem players as a base layer user interface for developers, LPs, traders, and chains. EVM chains with V4 enabled will have separate interfaces to distinguish between hooked and vanilla pools.\n\n**Hook Devs**: Hook developers thrive when LP\u2019ing is made easy, unlocking exposure to their unique market architecture\n\n**LPs**: Intuitive position management tools and highlighted yield farming opportunities for V4 pools\n\n**Traders**: Option to include V4 \u201chooked\u201d pools for unique trading strategies & best execution\n\n**DAO**: Expand V4 footprint across all chains and highlight market opportunities for unique market structures\n\n### Proposed Plan\n\nV4 Development Scope\n\n* V4 Liquidity management\n* Pool analytics with historical performance data\n* Oku V4 data API for anyone building in the Uniswap ecosystem\n* Hook pool discovery via V4 analytics dashboard\n* Routing support for V4 traders\n\nFor the one-time integration and build-out of V4 on Ethereum Mainnet into Oku, we are requesting a total of $250K. The Uniswap DAO could expect delivery within two months of the proposal passing. Post launch, Oku will continue to improve the V4 interface and iterate based on feedback.\n\n* Backend infrastructure: $150,000. This would primarily focus on indexing the V4 protocol, adding a routing setup for V4 markets, and updating our peripheral systems to support V4.\n* Frontend development: $100,000. There are two phases here. The first would be designing new UI elements for pool creation, V4 LPing, V4 analytics, V4 trading, and any other UI updates necessary to support V3 and V4 in the same interface. The second phase is implementing the design improvements.\n\n### Unichain Deployment on Oku\n\n* Within two weeks of this proposal passing, Unichain and the **V3 deployment** will be available in Oku. Unichain users will have access to a full suite of Oku features, including a smart routing system integrated into 10 trade routers and 11 bridges.\n* As soon as we have the minimum viable backend and frontend support for V4, we will integrate the Unichain V4 deployment.\n\nGiven our long-standing relationship with the DAO and our concurrent request for the initial V4 integration, GFX Labs will waive the standard integration fee for integrating Unichain with Oku. Recognizing the benefit of a synergistic V3/V4 offering, instead we are requesting $90k - $7.5k per month - to cover operational and maintenance related costs. This cost structure is representative of preferential pricing for the Uniswap DAO.\n\n### Permissionless Licensing Agreement\n\nGFX Labs is requesting a blanket [Additional Use Grant](https://support.uniswap.org/hc/en-us/articles/33829751588109-Uniswap-v4-licensing), which provides licensing permissions for V4 deployments to streamline the process of bringing V4 to new chains. As an established partner of the Uniswap ecosystem, this process maximizes the DAO\u2019s ability to scale efficiently, support hook innovation, and increase V4 pool dominance across EVM. A license for V4 deployments acts as an accelerant for adoption amongst new and existing networks and is critical for the Uniswap ecosystem to defend market dominance. GFX Labs strongly aligns with the UAC\u2019s suggestion to provide licensing rights to maintain a competitive edge before v4 becomes open source. Further, any deployment completed by GFX must be reviewed by the UAC to be considered official.\n\nWith a new emphasis on V4 infrastructure, Oku further aligns itself as a standard bearer for the Uniswap ecosystem, with a focus on expanding utility and interoperability across EVM environments. By funding this proposal, the DAO positions itself to scale V4 usage, promote novel onchain markets, and support unique market innovation from the ground up.",

According to [our analytics](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/treasury-delegation-round-2-ideas-thread/24667/13?u=tane) we shared in the original round 2 ideas thread, this program has been essential to keep the governance healthy and retain the active and capable delegates. At the same time, the originally promised time period has already passed, but the delegation has been kept as they didn't have their expirations. In addition, there have been discussions to consider how we proceed with the treasury delegation going forward. Through the process, we have decided to implement an important feature, expirations of the delegations to the Franchiser contract and create a robust system to keep the delegations enabled for the appropriate delegates.\n\n# Proposal Summary\n\nWe propose allocating **up to 15 million UNI** of total amount as the treasury delegation, distributing into selected delegates.\n\nWe select qualified delegates based on the objective criteria and metrics (the Delegate Reward Program Cycle 3 criteria/scoring + VP cut-off) after the application phase. We then introduce an election to choose the \"distinguished\" delegates from them.\n\nOnce we conclude the program details and delegates with each delegation amount, we will have an onchain vote to ratify the program, **apply the delegations with expirations provided by the new implementation by ScopeLift team**, and withdraw the original delegations as promised.\n\n# Motivation and Key Discussion Points\n\nDetails can be reviewed in the discussion forum\n\n# Proposal Specifications\n\nBased on the discussions in each thread and feedback from the delegates, we propose a balanced and feasible proposal for the next iterations of the treasury delegations. This framework focuses on increasing allocation, setting the delegation period, establishing sustainable evaluation methods, and building the operation for continuity of the program. At the same time, we view this treasury delegation is a temporary solution, rather than the permanent solution to the voting quorum challenge, but believe we have made critical improvements to the program for the DAO to consider the optimal solution to the problem.\n\n## Decide on its continuation, delegation amount and delegate selections\n\n### Program continuation\n\nFirst, we need an option to vote on for whether the DAO supports the improvements to the treasury delegation program.\n\n### Setting the increase or keep the amount\n\nAllocate **up to 15 million UNI**, distributing a certain amount of UNI to the two sets of delegates. This will provide sufficient voting power to the currently active **12 delegates**, allowing them to reflect their opinions in votes and put up proposals for the Uniswap DAO.\n\n## Delegate selections\n\nFirst, we need a thread for delegates to apply for this round. As before, we need to conduct applications and select delegates from there with the objective criteria that were used for the Delegate Reward Program Cycle 3 and VIP cut-off.\n\n- Only delegates who have participated in onchain voting for at least three months prior to the application post\n- Delegate Reward Program Cycle 3 criteria and scoring metrics\n  - We will re-calculate the scores for each delegate based on their recent activities (From the date when the Snapshot has concluded)\n- **No more than 1M UNI VP** has been delegated to the account. For the delegates who have received the original delegations, the current VP amount minus the amount of the delegations in the original program should be considered as the original delegations will be withdrawn, should this proposal be approved and proceeded. Any other temporary delegations will also be treated in the same manner.\n- Agree to adhere to the DAO Principles\n\nQualified delegates based on the above criteria and metrics will receive 1M VP delegations (1.5M in total as delegation hard limit).\n\nWe then conduct a Snapshot election to select 6 \"distinguished\" delegates from the candidates who are qualified delegates based on the objective criteria and scoring. The distinguished delegates will receive additional 500k VP delegations (2M in total as the hard limit).\n\n## Delegation period and evaluation mechanism\n\n### Expiration period\n\nErin and we have worked with the ScopeLift team to introduce the expiration of each delegation at the contract level, so that we are sure that delegation period is set onchain. The factory contract has been deployed on https://etherscan.io/address/0x807d62f954a2c3fb00ef32f064032228000b9899.\n\nWith the new implementation, we are able to set the expiration of delegations for each delegate. This proposal will utilize the new features to assign **12 months** as the expiration time for delegations.\n\n### Selected delegates' responsibilities\n\nEach delegate elected by the DAO, who will receive the treasury delegation should maintain the following requirements:\n\n- Maintain a minimum 80% voting participation rate over the past 3 months.\n    - Participation rate calculation:\n        - Includes both Snapshot and on-chain proposals\n        - Excludes cancelled proposals\n        - Measured from the date of Snapshot approval\n- Maintain a minimum of 80% justification rate for all votes cast in the delegation thread. The motivation is that a delegate\u2019s primary responsibility is not only to vote on behalf of their delegators but also to provide a clear, reasoned explanation for each vote. This transparency helps the community understand the basis for decisions, reassuring them that the vote was carefully considered and aligned with community interests. Providing a well-founded rationale is a fundamental duty to maintain open communication and uphold the trust placed by delegators.\n\n### Program management\n\nTo continue the program effectively and secure the Uniswap governance, we will work with the Uniswap Accountability Committee to smoothly operate the program including actions like below:\n\n- Publish every 3 months report of the evaluation\n- Delegate selection management and evaluation of the program for each round\n\n### Evaluation and revocation process\n\nEvery 3 months, we will publish a report in a dedicated thread on the forum detailing the proposals from the past three months, including a list of the delegates who met the participation requirements and those who did not, following a similar format used on the delegate rewards program. \n\nDelegates who fail to meet the minimum participation requirements will have their delegations revoked via an onchain voting. (NOTE: the new implementation hasn't supported early terminations based on the off-chain conditions yet.) They will be eligible to reapply during the following cycle. We will create a proposal to revoke their delegations.\n\nWe will also re-evaluate the whole program in early 2026 (after 9 months of the program start) or earlier if the new initiative like Unistaker is introduced to change the landscape of the delegations in the Uniswap DAO.\n\n## Proposed actions and upcoming votes\n\nThe next actions required to take forward this proposal are as follows.\n\n1. Determine program continuation and Treasury Delegation amount (Snapshot)\n2. Elect the distinguished delegates from the qualified delegates (Snapshot)\n3. Onchain delegation with expirations to ratify the changes (Onchain)\n\n### Proposal 1: Decide on program continuation and the total delegation amount (Snapshot)\n\n- If \"For\" to the program continuation, the delegation amount and delegation details are;\n    - Up to 15M\n    - 12 delegates\n    - 1M to all selected delegates (capped at 1.5M), additional 500k to Tier 1 delegates (capped 2M)\n    - 12 months' expirations\n- If \"Against\" the program continuation,\n    - We will come up with a proposal to appropriately wind down the current treasury delegation program or propose another revision of this proposal.\n\n### Application period: selection of delegates for the treasury delegation program\n\n- Between Proposal 1 and 2, we will have a thread for delegates to apply for the program. All prospective delegates must submit their applications through this designated thread for consideration.\n- After an enough time, we select qualified 12 delegates.\n\n### Proposal 2: Elect the distinguished delegates (Snapshot)\n\nAfter selecting the qualified 12 delegates, we create a Snapshot vote for the tokenholders to approve 6 distinguished delegates.\n\n### Proposal 3: Execute the delegations with expirations to ratify the changes (Onchain)\n\nCreate an onchain proposal to ratify the changes voted on Proposal 1 and 2, and execute transactions to delegate the appropriate amount of voting powers from the treasury to elected delegates with the expiration set and withdraw the delegations done in the original program.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nWe (Tan\u00e9) are willing to apply for the proposed treasury delegation as a recipient if no critical objection as we believe our further involvement is beneficial to the DAO while we are the author of the program proposal. We will abstain from voting on the first Snapshot, but would vote on the ratification onchain proposal.",

An evolution of the committee has led it to become the DAO\u2019s go-to operational body for handling a multitude of different responsibilities, although it merely began as a committee to oversee cross-chain deployments upon expiration of the Uniswap v3 Business Source License (BSL). Today, the UAC oversees:\n* Cross-chain deployment coordination\n* ENS record management\n* Disbursement and accounting of service provider, grantee, and working groups\u2019 compensation\n* Custody of DAO-approved funds on Ethereum mainnet\n* Incentive distribution across a multitude of EVM-compatible chains\n* Governance community calls\n* Assisting with miscellaneous DAO operations like helping teams sponsor proposals\n* Managing the newly established Foundation Feedback Group (FFG)\nThis attached report on the forums outlines the specific operations behind the UAC from the previous season, along with an update regarding the financial situation of DAO programs and working groups. The last section will act as the request for comment (RFC) to renew the UAC and balance accounts.\n\nDue to Snapshot posting limits, we urge delegates to please review the full report and RFC. \n\nA summary of the Renewal ask and proposed budget is below:\n* We will maintain the 5-member team as it\u2019s an optimal number for dividing workload and distributing multisig security responsibilities.\n* Increase the budgeted weekly hours from 7.5 to 10, bringing the monthly total 40 hours.\n* Sustain the staggered election system to retain three current UAC members to prevent junctions between ongoing projects and training entirely new teams.

      "title": "[1IP-89] Update to Resolver Access Requirements for Fusion Order Flow",
      "body": "## **Summary**\n\nThis proposal seeks to remove the 5% Unicorn Power (UP) staking threshold currently required for resolvers to obtain access to Fusion exclusive orders. Under the proposed update, any resolver will gain full access to Fusion's exclusive order flow upon successful completion of the due diligence verification process and issuance of the corresponding Resolver NFT for verification.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nThe 5% UP threshold was initially introduced as a mechanism to ensure that active, aligned participants contributed to protocol security and long-term engagement. However, as the Fusion ecosystem evolved, this requirement has become a barrier to entry for new resolvers and a limiting factor for competition and liquidity access.\n\nRemoving the UP threshold will streamline onboarding, foster broader adoption of Fusion and widen the liquidity accessed through Fusion protocol. Due diligence verification and Resolver NFT issuance will remain the key mechanism ensuring resolver accountability and risk management.\n\n## **Specification**\n\n* The requirement for resolvers to hold or stake 5% of Unicorn Power to access Fusion exclusive orders will be removed.\n\n* Access to Fusion exclusive order flow will be granted upon issuance of the Resolver NFT, which will be minted following successful completion by the resolver of the due diligence verification.\n\n* 1inch Foundation remains responsible for facilitating resolver onboarding. Under this proposal, 1inch Foundation requests 1inch Business to host and administer the onboarding and verification process, including automatic Resolver NFT generation.\n\n* Recognizing the importance of community mechanisms, Resolver farms remain part of the framework. While not a prerequisite for participation, they continue to exist as an optional layer that can be activated to support incentivization, enhance competition and improve overall performance when needed.\n\n* This proposal continues the framework established under[ **1IP-78**](https://snapshot.box/#/s:1inch.eth/proposal/0xd0707ca9ba2094415d261cb40ccf06ed92bd4940ec5a83b3ab2239e38f05735f \"https://snapshot.box/#/s:1inch.eth/proposal/0xd0707ca9ba2094415d261cb40ccf06ed92bd4940ec5a83b3ab2239e38f05735f\"), requires to follow a tiered fee structure. It reaffirms that Resolver Access Fees can be enabled as part of the protocol design. This structure applies to resolvers acting as infrastructure integrators. The allocation of collected Resolver Access Fees (e.g. to the DAO treasury or other recipients) will be determined by the DAO through future governance decisions.\n\n## **Rationale**\n\nThis adjustment simplifies the resolver onboarding process while maintaining the same compliance and verification standards. By removing the UP threshold, the protocol can:\n\n* Increase competition among resolvers;\n\n* Improve liquidity depth and execution quality;\n\n* Support broader adoption of Fusion as an open, competitive settlement layer.\n\nThe due diligence and NFT framework ensures that access remains restricted to verified and accountable counterparts, preserving the integrity and security of the Fusion ecosystem.\n\n## **Implementation**\n\n* The existing resolver onboarding flow will be updated so that due diligence verification  \u2014 not UP staking \u2014 serves as a trigger for Resolver NFT issuance, which defines access eligibility.\n\n* 1inch Foundation requests 1inch Business, which is the 1inch Web3 APIs portal, to implement and technically enable the updated onboarding and Resolver NFT-issuance process within the existing resolver infrastructure.\n\n* Security and deployment: the 1inch Fusion mode has already been audited and fully deployed. This proposal does not modify smart-contract logic or auction mechanics; it only broadens resolver participation by adjusting access conditions. As such, no negative security implications are anticipated.\n* Security and deployment: the 1inch Fusion mode has already been audited and fully deployed.

      "title": "[1IP-88] Transfer Of Control Of The 1inch dApp To 1inch/ Degensoft Group; Domain Separation And Brand Alignment",
      "body": "## **Simple Summary**\n\n\n\nThis proposal transfers the independent control of the 1inch dApp to 1inch/ Degensoft Group and formalizes domain separation across the ecosystem. The DAO continues as the governance hub at 1inch.network, and the 1inch Foundation remains the DAO's off-chain representative. The dApp will continue operation at [1inch.com](http://1inch.com/) under 1inch/ Degensoft Group. The dApp remains within the broader 1inch ecosystem and brand, but ownership and decision-making for the dApp are vested in 1inch/ Degensoft Group.\n\n\n\nIn parallel, this proposal authorizes a coordinated product and website update to align with the new structure, clearly signal the distinct roles of the 1inch DAO, 1inch Foundation, and 1inch/ Degensoft Group, and empower 1inch Labs to update the design of the 1INCH icon, 1inch.network domain and its community-facing content for the integrity of the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n## **Abstract**\n\n\n\nSince its launch, the 1inch dApp has been the entry point to the 1inch Network \u2014 powering billions in trading volume, onboarding millions of users, and establishing itself as one of the most trusted DeFi interfaces in the world.\n\n\n\nThe success of the dApp, however, has also revealed the realities of running large-scale, user-facing infrastructure. It demands constant engineering investment, security monitoring, and risk management considerations. These functions, by their nature, require accountability and continuous delivery \u2014 responsibilities that the 1inch Foundation and 1inch DAO, in its current form, cannot yet assume.\n\n\n\nThis proposal, therefore, recommends structured shifts within the 1inch ecosystem:\n\n\n\n* 1inch/ Degensoft Group becomes the owner of the 1inch dApp and operates it independently at [1inch.com](http://1inch.com/).  \n\n* 1inch DAO retains stewardship of governance, staking, open-source protocols, and community-led activities at 1inch.network.  \n\n* 1inch Foundation continues as an ecosystem steward and the DAO's off-chain representative.\n\n\n\nThis change clarifies responsibilities, strengthens sustainability, and allows both decentralization and operational excellence to thrive side by side.\n\n\n\nConcurrently, we will will update the 1INCH icon and the 1inch.network page.\n\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\n\n\nThe 1inch dApp became the gateway to the original vision of 1inch Network products \u2014 an intuitive interface providing access to liquidity across chains, powered by open-source tech governed by the community.\n\n\n\nFrom hackathon project to global infrastructure, the dApp proved that decentralized access can scale. With scale, complexity followed. Running a global, user-facing service is not a resistant endeavor. It requires:\n\n\n\n* permanent investment in backend infrastructure and frontend development,  \n\n* continuous monitoring for performance and exploits,  \n\n* integration of security providers and risk management tools,  \n\n* around-the-clock operational support.\n\n\n\nThese are not \"nice to haves\" \u2014 they are non-negotiable. The 1inch Foundation and 1inch DAO, despite its critical role in governance, has never directly maintained this infrastructure and does not currently possess the operational prerequisites for a global service: 24/7 on-call coverage, service-level ownership (SLOs), incident-command authority, vendor and data-processing agreements, as well as the ongoing product and UX iteration, coordinated security management and partner operations that keep a product healthy at scale.\n\n\n\nConcentrating independent management in a single accountable operator closes this gap, reduces coordination overhead, and enables fast, transparent decision-making when reliability or user safety is at stake. Importantly, this ownership centralization does not compromise decentralization: the protocols remain open-source and DAO-governed, and the dApp remains a non-custodial interface where users retain full control over their keys and on-chain interactions.\n\n\n\n**Visual alignment.** The 1inch brand remains one and the same. This proposal triggers a coordinated update to reflect the new structure and to ensure integrity of branding within the 1inch ecosystem. Updating the 1INCH icon and 1inch.network page will align all layers ([1inch.com](http://1inch.com/)/  [1inch.io](http://1inch.io/), 1inch.network) and third-party placements (integrators) to a single standard, making the ecosystem's coherence self-evident.\n\n\n\n### **Why Now?**\n\n\n\nThe recent debate around DAO sustainability sharpened this issue. Calls for redirecting all revenue to the DAO raised valid concerns about long-term independence, but also exposed the gap between ideals and current capacity. Sustainability begins with capability. Without technical accountability and operational processes, treasury accumulation alone cannot secure the future.\n\n\n\nThis proposal offers a balanced path forward: ownership and operational responsibility for the dApp lie with those able to deliver, while the DAO strengthens its role as governance steward of open-source protocols and token utility.\n\n\n\n## **Specification**\n\n\n\n### **Transfer of Control**\n\n\n\n* **Subject Of Transfer:** The 1inch dApp (user interface and associated application assets).  \n\n* **New Manager:** 1inch/ Degensoft Group becomes the independent owner of the dApp and exercises full control over product and operational decisions.  \n\n* **Scope:** The transfer encompasses the dApp codebase and associated application and operational assets necessary to run the dApp in production.  \n\n* **Effective Date:** Upon passage of this 1IP and completion of the transfer documentation by 1inch Foundation.\n\n\n\n### **Domain Separation**\n\n\n\n* **1inch.network** \u2014 community and governance hub (DAO), which hosts governance, proposals, voting, staking, delegation, resolver onboarding, and protocol documentation. The domain ownership shall be placed with 1inch Foundation.  \n\n* [**1inch.com**](http://1inch.com/) \u2014 home of the 1inch dApp (1inch/ Degensoft Group).  \n\n* [**1inch.io**](http://1inch.io/)  \u2014 temporary traffic proxy**,** used as a routing layer to maintain continuity and discoverability while directing users to the correct surfaces.\n\n\n\n### **Visual Actions**\n\n\n\n* **Token icon:** authorize updating the 1INCH token icon;  \n\n* **1inch.network:** authorize the update of the 1inch.network site to reflect its role as the DAO/governance hub (governance, staking, delegation, resolvers, docs) in line with the ecosystem branding;  \n\n* **Implementation authority:** empower 1inch Labs to lead the project;  \n\n* **Design alignment:** ensure consistent typography, color, iconography, and component guidelines across all layers of the 1inch Network.\n\n\n\n### **Governance and Ecosystem continuity**\n\n\n\n* The DAO retains authority over 1INCH token, governance, staking, delegation, open-source protocols, and Resolver onboarding and management at 1inch.network.  \n\n* The 1inch Foundation remains the DAO's off-chain representative and ecosystem steward, unless the DAO votes otherwise.  \n\n* The dApp continues operation under the 1inch brand and remains part of the broader 1inch ecosystem.  \n\n* DAO will update 1inch DAO Guidelines to reflect respective changes.  \n\n* This alignment clarifies control and decision-making while preserving a unified user understanding of the 1inch Network.\n\n\n\n## **Rationale and Considerations**\n\n\n\nThis structure reflects lessons learned since inception:\n\n\n\n* **Align responsibilities with capabilities** \u2014 the DAO governs, the Foundation fosters, and 1inch/ Degensoft Group owns and controls the dApp.  \n\n* **Preserve decentralization and user control** \u2014 protocols remain open-source and DAO-governed; the dApp remains a non-custodial interface where users control their keys and on-chain interactions.  \n\n* **Secure operational excellence** \u2014 a single accountable owner enables 24/7 on-call, incident command and coordinated product/UX iteration, reducing coordination overhead and accelerating clear decision-making.  \n\n* **Governance clarity and accountability** \u2014 the DAO's authority over governance mechanisms, token utility, and protocol stewardship remains intact; the Foundation continues as the DAO's off-chain representative unless changed by vote.  \n\n* **Design coherence and integrity** \u2014 a unified design preserves brand integrity.\n\n\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n\n\nThe 1inch Network has always been a story of innovation and community. The dApp made that story tangible for millions of users; the DAO made it participatory; the Foundation made it sustainable; and 1inch Labs engineered it into existence. This proposal evolves that story by transferring control of the dApp to a new 1inch/ Degensoft Group under independent control, while reaffirming the DAO's authority over governance and protocols at 1inch.network.\n\n\n\nThe result is a stronger, clearer, and more sustainable 1inch ecosystem \u2014 true to its founding values, and adapted to the realities of scale.",

      "title": "[1IP-84] 1inch DAO Forum Migration Proposal: Commonwealth to Discourse",
      "body": "# **1IP-XX: 1inch DAO Forum Migration Proposal: Commonwealth to Discourse**\n\n## **Executive Summary**\n\nThe 1inch DAO proposes migrating our community forum from Commonwealth to Discourse to improve user experience and community engagement. This migration will provide a more stable and feature-rich platform that better serves the needs of our growing community. We will be adopting Discourse's Business Plan at $500/month with an additional one-time migration cost of $10,000.\n\n## **Background**\n\nThe 1inch DAO currently uses Commonwealth as our primary forum platform for governance discussions and proposal development. While Commonwealth has served our initial needs, we have identified several limitations that Discourse addresses more effectively.\n\n## **Platform Comparison: Commonwealth vs. Discourse**\n\n### **Commonwealth (Current Platform)**\n\n-   Web3-native platform designed for DAOs\n    \n-   Integrated token-gated features\n    \n-   Limited customization options\n    \n-   Smaller development team and community\n    \n-   Occasional performance issues with larger discussions\n    \n-   Basic moderation tools\n    \n\n### **Discourse (Proposed Platform)**\n\n-   Mature, battle-tested forum software used by major organizations\n    \n-   Extensive plugin ecosystem and customization options\n    \n-   Superior performance and scalability\n    \n-   Advanced moderation and community management tools\n    \n-   Mobile-responsive design with dedicated apps\n    \n-   Regular updates and active development\n    \n-   Proven track record with other DeFi communities\n    \n\n## **Proposed Discourse Business Plan**\n\nBased on consultation with Discourse, we are selecting the **Business Plan at $500/month**, which includes:\n\n-   Up to 500K browser page views or API calls per month\n    \n-   100GB of Storage\n    \n-   300K Monthly Emails\n    \n-   Unlimited Users\n    \n-   15 Staff Users\n    \n-   Standard Migration support\n    \n-   Business Authentication (OpenID Connect, Custom OAuth2, DiscourseConnect SSO, and more)\n    \n\n### **Why Business Plan Over Enterprise**\n\nWhile Discourse offered an Enterprise plan at $2,500/month, the Business plan meets our current needs:\n\n-   Our projected traffic falls within the 500K monthly page views\n    \n-   100GB storage is sufficient for our forum content\n    \n-   15 staff users accommodate our moderation team\n    \n-   Business authentication options support our wallet integration needs\n    \n\nThe main trade-off is that we'll need to work with Discourse partners for the migration rather than their internal team, but this is addressed through our separate migration budget.\n\n## **Migration Budget**\n\n### **Recurring Costs**\n\n-   **Discourse Business Plan**: $500/month ($6,000 annually)\n    \n\n### **One-Time Costs**\n\n-   **Migration Services**: $10,000 (via Discourse partner)\n\n- **Budget Buffer**: $3,000 (In the event of unforeseen costs)\n    \n-   **Total First Year Cost**: $19,000\n    \n-   **Annual Cost Thereafter**: $6,000\n    \n**Note**: These funds will be transferred to the migration partner through 1inch Labs. Through this proposal, the DAO asks 1inch Labs to act as a payment agent, and the DAO will compensate 1inch Labs for acting as a payment agent.\n  \n  \n\n## **Migration Scope**\n\n### **Content Migration**\n\n-   All existing forum posts and discussions\n    \n-   User accounts and profiles\n    \n-   Historical proposal discussions\n    \n-   Media attachments and embedded content\n    \n-   Category structure and organization\n    \n\n### **Feature Mapping**\n\n-   Commonwealth's token-gated access \u2192 Discourse group permissions\n    \n-   Proposal templates \u2192 Discourse topic templates\n    \n-   Voting discussions \u2192 Structured polling features\n    \n-   User reputation \u2192 Discourse trust levels\n    \n\n### **What Won't Migrate**\n\n-   Direct on-chain voting integration (will link to Snapshot)\n    \n-   Token balance displays (can be added via custom development later)\n    \n-   Some Commonwealth-specific features that lack Discourse equivalents\n    \n\n## **Expected Benefits**\n\n### **Improved User Experience**\n\n-   Better mobile experience with responsive design\n    \n-   Faster page loads and search functionality\n    \n-   More intuitive navigation and discovery\n    \n-   Enhanced notification system\n    \n\n### **Community Management**\n\n-   Advanced moderation tools\n    \n-   Better spam prevention\n    \n-   Detailed analytics and insights\n    \n-   Flexible permission systems\n    \n\n### **Long-term Sustainability**\n\n-   Established platform with guaranteed longevity\n    \n-   Regular security updates\n    \n-   Large ecosystem of developers and plugins\n    \n-   Extensive documentation and community support\n    \n\n## **Success Metrics**\n\nWe will measure migration success through:\n\n-   Successful transfer of 100% of historical content\n    \n-   User retention rate of 80%+ post-migration\n    \n-   Increased daily active users by 25% within 3 months\n    \n-   Improved average session duration\n    \n-   Reduced moderation workload through better tools\n    \n\n## **Community Communication Plan**\n\n### **Pre-Migration**\n\n-   Announcement post explaining the migration rationale\n    \n-   FAQ addressing common concerns\n    \n-   Beta tester recruitment\n    \n\n### **During Migration**\n\n-   Regular status updates\n    \n-   Dedicated support channel\n    \n-   Migration timeline visibility\n    \n\n### **Post-Migration**\n\n-   Welcome guide for the new platform\n    \n-   Video tutorials for key features\n    \n-   Feedback collection and iteration\n    \n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nMigrating from Commonwealth to Discourse represents a strategic investment in our community infrastructure. The Business Plan at $500/month provides excellent value for a mature, stable platform that will serve the 1inch DAO's needs for years to come. The one-time migration cost of $10,000 ensures professional handling of our valuable community content.\n\nThis migration prioritizes user experience and community engagement while maintaining fiscal responsibility. We recommend approval of this proposal to enhance our governance forum and better serve our growing community.",

      "body": "**Author:** [Danylo](https://gov.1inch.io/profile/id/129751)\n\n****\n\n**Research Proposal**\n\n\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\n\n\nThis proposal initiates a research phase to determine the most feasible and secure way to implement cross-chain swaps between Bitcoin and EVM-compatible networks within the 1inch Fusion ecosystem.\n\n\n\nThe motivation comes from an increasing need to support native BTC interactions without relying on custodial bridges, wrapped assets, or third-party validators. While Ethereum-based systems offer flexibility via smart contracts, Bitcoin's UTXO model and limited scripting capabilities make integration challenging and unexplored.\n\n\n\nThis research phase will assess Bitcoin\u2019s native technologies, define required order lifecycle steps, and evaluate feasible design strategies. The outcome will be a System Requirements Document (SRD), which outlines architectural options, potential risks, and implementation recommendations.\n\n\n\n**2. Problem Statement**\n\n\n\nDespite advancements in DeFi, truly decentralized cross-chain swaps remain elusive. Existing solutions are hindered by reliance on custodians, wrapped tokens, or validator networks\u2014all of which introduce counterparty risk and centralization.\n\n\n\nThere is currently no trustless standard for Bitcoin \u2194 EVM swaps that allows users to remain in full control of their assets, while also achieving verifiable, on-chain settlement. This proposal addresses that gap by exploring native Bitcoin-side mechanisms to support such interoperability.\n\n\n\n**3. Objectives**\n\n\n\n- Identify all lifecycle operations required for RFQbased cross-chain swaps (creation, acceptance, escrow, fulfillment, refund, cancellation).\n\n\n\n- Investigate technical feasibility on the Bitcoin side using native tools: Taproot, PSBT, Miniscript, hashlocks, etc.\n\n\n\n- Conduct comparative analysis of possible designs and prototype key flows on testnet.\n\n\n\n- Propose one or more architectures for implementing the required flows.\n\n\n\n- Evaluate tradeoffs in UX, complexity, cost, security, and tooling support.\n\n\n\n- Produce a System Requirements Document (SRD) including recommendations, risk analysis, and diagrams.\n\n\n\n**4. System Overview**\n\n\n\nThe goal is to enable secure atomic swaps between Bitcoin and EVM-compatible chains without relying on centralized bridges or wrapped assets. This requires a reliable lifecycle design for swap initiation, escrow management, fulfillment, and cancellation\u2014all enforceable through native Bitcoin scripts and off-chain coordination. This section summarizes the high-level interaction, to be refined during discovery:\n\n\n\n**Actors:**\n\n\n\n- **Market Maker (MM):** Posts quote with price and BTC address.\n\n\n\n- **Taker:** Selects a quote and initiates a swap by locking ETH and participating in a BTC contract.\n\n\n\n- **Resolver (offchain service):** Observes transactions and assists in coordination, but does not hold funds.\n\n\n\n**High-Level Flow:**\n\n\n\n1. MM places a quote (off-chain system or signed transaction; research will clarify).\n\n\n\n2. Taker accepts and funds ETH escrow.\n\n\n\n3. MM or resolver funds BTC output under Taproot script.\n\n\n\n4. Secret is revealed and used to complete swap.\n\n\n\n5. Timeout and fallback logic ensures refunds if conditions fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Outstanding research questions:**\n\n\n\n- Where and how are quotes stored and signed?\n\n\n\n- What validation is required for quote authenticity and timeliness?\n\n\n\n- How do resolvers coordinate without introducing trust assumptions?\n\n\n\n**5. Scope of Work**\n\n\n\n**5.1 Activities**\n\n\n\n- Requirements workshop (based on 1inch whitepaper)\n\n\n\n- Research into Bitcoin scripting models\n\n\n\n- Comparative analysis of Taproot trees, PSBT lifecycle\n\n\n\n- Design of multiple swap lifecycle flows\n\n\n\n- Diagrams: state machine, sequence, system context\n\n\n\n- Risk analysis and mitigation planning\n\n\n\n- Recommendations on optimal tech path\n\n\n\n**5.2 Deliverables**\n\n\n\n1. System Requirements Document (SRD)\n\n\n\n2. Architecture overview\n\n\n\n3. Comparative analysis of scripting/transaction strategies\n\n\n\n4. Tradeoff analysis of approaches\n\n\n\n5.

      "title": "[1IP-81] Next Phase of the Alternative Interface: Solana, Security & P2P Updates",
      "body": "## Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis proposal suggests continuing the development of the alternative 1inch interface over the next 6 months, focusing on maintenance, enhanced stability and security, implementation of a p2p update system via WebTorrent, and integration of Solana network support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis proposal seeks to extend funding for the alternative 1inch interface project for 6 months. The main priorities will be project maintenance, optimization of existing functionality, strengthening the application's supply chain security, implementing a decentralized update delivery system via WebTorrent, and adding support for the Solana network. Testing will also be intensified to improve application stability. The requested amount is \\$87,000, to be streamed monthly over six months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious proposals 1IP-50 and 1IP-66 enabled the creation of a functional, open-source, and modular 1inch interface supporting swap and Fusion+. In preparing the next development phase, we considered feedback from DAO delegates, including concerns about scope and budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, the grant duration has been reduced to 6 months and the overall budget to $87,000. We are focusing on tasks that enhance the resilience, reliability, and independence of the interface without introducing features that might be perceived as excessive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA key priority for this phase is improving the security of the codebase and the frontend delivery chain. In light of the recent hack of the main 1inch interface, we will pay special attention to auditing dependencies and reducing risks associated with third-party libraries and build pipelines. Decentralized alternatives must be not only functional, but also secure and trustworthy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following tasks are planned over the 6-month period:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Audit of dependencies and strengthening of supply chain security**: a comprehensive review of all project dependencies will be conducted, potentially unsafe libraries will be removed, and the security of the frontend build and delivery process will be enhanced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Implementation of a p2p update system via WebTorrent**, enabling users to receive updates directly from each other without relying on centralized servers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Integration of Solana support**: development of a user interface and adaptation to the specific RPC characteristics of this network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Swap flow optimization**: improvement of user experience, reliability, and responsiveness of the interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Involvement of a QA engineer** to carry out systematic testing and increase overall application stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Ongoing project maintenance**, including infrastructure, regular updates, monitoring, and continued development of the phishing protection system, which has proven effective in previous phases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of discussions with DAO delegates, we revised our priorities and reduced the project scope. This allows us to focus on the core aspects of stability, resilience, and decentralization. By removing broader functionality, the project became more focused and budget-friendly while still delivering strategic value to the DAO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe selected WebTorrent as a promising technology for implementing decentralized update delivery. Support for the Solana network will open the door to a multi-chain architecture, expanding the reach and flexibility of the interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Considerations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Security:**\n\n\n\nSpecial attention will be paid to code security, phishing protection (including source verification), and correct RPC interaction. Auditing dependencies will also help prevent potential dApp supply chain attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Resilience:**\n\n\n\nUsing WebTorrent and IPFS+ENS will reduce reliance on centralized infrastructure and make the interface more accessible across various regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Budget:**\n\n\n\nThe requested budget is 87,000 USDC for 6 months. If the proposal is approved, the total amount will be transferred to the 1inch DAO Operations Multi-Sig wallet (0x45e84e10e8E85c583C002A40007D10629EF80fAF) and paid to the recipient address (0x568D3086f5377e59BF2Ef77bd1051486b581b214) as follows:\n\n\n\n* 14,500 USDC will be transferred immediately as an upfront payment.\n\n\n\n* The remaining 72,500 USDC will be streamed over the following 5 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Team:**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* 2 fullstack developers\n\n\n\n* 1 QA engineer\n\n\n\n* UI/UX designer (as needed)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject GitHub repository: [link](https://github.com/1inch-community/interface)\n\n\n\nProject GitHub Paging staging link [link](https://1inch-community.github.io/interface/)",

      "title": "[1IP-79] Trading Terminal, Limit Orders, and Solana Integration for the Alternative Modular Interface of 1inch",
      "body": "**Author**: [Denis](https://gov.1inch.io/profile/id/133722)\n\n## Simple Summary:\n\n\n\nHello everyone! This is the team behind the alternative 1inch interface. We\u2019re back with a new initiative: building on top of the existing interface, we aim to develop a full-featured trading terminal with limit order support, enhanced swap flow UX, and Solana integration.\n\nWe are requesting 12 months and \\$288,000 in funding to complete this work.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Abstract:\n\n\n\nOur goal is not just to add new features, but to take a major step forward in the development of the alternative 1inch interface. We plan to implement:\n\n\n\n* support for limit orders,\n\n* a user-friendly trading terminal with charts, order books, and trade history,\n\n* an improved swap flow where all actions (approve, permit, wrap) are unified into a single clear sequence,\n\n* Solana integration,\n\n* interface deployment on IPFS with ENS access,\n\n* phishing protection and technical documentation.\n\n\n\nWe believe these improvements will make the interface even more user-friendly, secure, and in demand \u2014 both for users and developers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Motivation:\n\n\n\nFrom the beginning, our goal has been to build the best Web3 interface \u2014 focusing on simplicity, openness, speed, and independence. Currently, the interface supports Fusion and Fusion+ swaps, and this alone has made us competitive. But traders need more than just fast swaps \u2014 they need tools: orders, charts, history, control. And we want to give them that.\n\n\n\nWe also want to highlight an issue we\u2019ve encountered: in the past six months, we\u2019ve discovered over five phishing sites using our code. This is alarming. We've already taken a major step by implementing the DevPortal Proxy, which not only optimizes requests but also helps detect unauthorized copies of the interface and analyze suspicious activity. It's not just a proxy server \u2014 it's a full-fledged monitoring and anti-phishing system.\n\n\n\nTo improve stability and manageability, the proxy infrastructure was migrated to Kubernetes. This gives us flexibility in deployment and scaling, and allows us to relocate proxy services to any region quickly. This approach significantly increases the system\u2019s reliability and resilience against external threats.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, as our team grew, we realized the importance of comprehensive documentation \u2014 not only for ourselves, but also for future auditors who need to understand the project architecture. As part of this grant, we aim to document key parts of the codebase.\n\n\n\n## Specification:\n\n\n\nWe currently have over 50 tasks queued for improving code, architecture, and security. For this proposal, we will focus on the following areas:\n\n\n\n* Implementing a limit order module based on 1inch DevPortal and onchain sources.\n\n* Developing a trading terminal:\n\n\n\n  * integrating price charts (currently researching the optimal solution),\n\n  * displaying order books,\n\n  * trade history and user order history.\n\n* Building a complete activity history in the Account View section.\n\n* Sending and receiving funds directly in the interface.\n\n* Updating the swap UX \u2014 combining all steps into a clear, visual flow.\n\n* Extending the embeddable widget system (currently a basic swap widget is implemented; we want to expand this and deliver the full trading terminal as a widget).\n\n* Adding support for the Solana network \u2014 tokens, routing, compatibility.\n\n* Deploying the interface on IPFS with ENS (we\u2019ve already secured the 1inch-community.eth name, test version available at [https://1inch-community.eth.limo](https://1inch-community.eth.limo)).\n\n* Automating publishing and updates via CI/CD to IPFS.\n\n* Further improving the phishing protection system.\n\n* Preparing architectural and technical documentation.\n\n* Direct integration of hardware wallets (Ledger and Trezor \u2014 technical research is underway).\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow I would like to demonstrate an early draft of the trading terminal:\n\n![image](https://assets.commonwealth.im/ea8e4689-bb0f-40b7-a146-3ab89b2b33f4.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Rationale:\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve come a long way \u2014 from a basic swap interface (1IP-50) to a modular solution with Fusion+ support and phishing protection (1IP-66). Everything we do is open, transparent, and flexible. Now it\u2019s time to expand the functionality and provide traders with advanced tools. This will enable integration into DApps, wallets, and trading platforms. We aim not just to catch up \u2014 but to lead.\n\n\n\nWe also highly value community input in this project\u2019s development. If you have suggestions, ideas, or comments \u2014 we would love to hear them in the forum thread. Your feedback helps guide us in the right direction and make the interface better for everyone.\n\n\n\n## Considerations:\n\n\n\n**Security:**\n\n\n\n* All interaction with 1inch Dev Portal occurs only through https and an authorized proxy, which ensures a secure channel.\n\n* The proxy infrastructure is protected using WAF, CORS, and a monitoring system.\n\n* The architecture is built on Kubernetes, ensuring rapid response to threats and scalability.\n\n\n\n**Infrastructure and Distribution:**\n\n\n\n* Production deployment on IPFS with ENS.\n\n* Automatic CI/CD publishing for new builds.\n\n* Phishing monitoring system.\n\n\n\n**Documentation and Support:**\n\n\n\n* Code documentation for better internal understanding and external auditing.\n\n* Continued modularization and embeddability improvements.\n\n\n\n## Budget and Team:\n\n\n\n* Total budget: \\$288,000 for 12 months.\n\n* If approved, 288,000 USDC will be transferred to the Operations Multi-Sig (0x45e84e10e8E85c583C002A40007D10629EF80fAF) and then paid out to 0x568D3086f5377e59BF2Ef77bd1051486b581b214 as follows:\n\n\n\n  * An initial payment of 24,000 USDC as an advance.\n\n  * The remaining 264,000 USDC to be streamed over the next 11 months.\n\n\n\n**Team:**\n\n\n\n* Lead developer \u2014 author of 1IP-50 and 1IP-66,\n\n* Frontend developer with 10+ years of experience,\n\n* UI/UX designer who has been helping us deliver the best user experience,\n\n* QA engineer and former QA core team member at 1inch with deep DeFi testing experience.\n\n\n\n**Funding will cover:**\n\n\n\n* Developer services, including:\n\n\n\n  * Solana integration and system modernization,\n\n  * Infrastructure maintenance and extension (CI/CD, proxy, servers),\n\n  * Documentation preparation, publication, and maintenance.\n\n* QA services:\n\n\n\n  * Swap and limit order flow testing,\n\n  * Widget system testing,\n\n  * Desktop app testing.\n\n* Design services:\n\n\n\n  * UI/UX improvements and architecture updates,\n\n  * Design for the limit order interface,\n\n  * UI/UX enhancements for Solana support.\n\n* Security, testing, and update releases.\n\n* Domain costs.\n\n* Other services required for monitoring and security.\n\n* A small reserve for future team expansion.\n\n\n\n## 1IP-66 Work Report:\n\n\n\nHere we would like to share the results of the work completed under 1IP-66.\n\n\n\n**Fully Completed:**\n\n\n\n* Fusion+ functionality implemented, including related refactoring for cross-chain flow.\n\n* Private proxy server-based phishing protection system deployed.\n\n* Account View implemented.\n\n* CI/CD modernization completed \u2014 automatic publishing of all project libraries to [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/1inch-community/packages?repo_name=interface).\n\n* Major infrastructure upgrade: proxy wrapped in Kubernetes for flexibility and scalability, with global load balancing for improved performance.\n\n\n\n**Not Fully Completed:**\n\n\n\n* Permit2: the frontend implementation is done, but due to issues on the 1inch DevPortal side, it\u2019s temporarily disabled. We\u2019ve reported the issue to the 1inch team and are waiting for a fix. As soon as it\u2019s resolved, we\u2019ll re-enable, test, and release Permit2 functionality.\n\n* We weren\u2019t able to fully implement automatic code signing for the macOS desktop app, due to communication issues with Apple support. We\u2019re currently resolving this, and will resume once we gain the necessary developer rights.\n\n* Initial load performance: to protect users from phishing, we implemented an interface verification system, which increased initial load time. This is a temporary issue \u2014 we plan to fix it soon by introducing bypass mechanisms without compromising user safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject GitHub repository: [link](https://github.com/1inch-community/interface)  \n\nProject GitHub Paging staging [link](https://1inch-community.github.io/interface)",

      "title": "[1IP-78] Protocol Upgrades; Order Settlement in LOP; Incentives in Protocols",
      "body": "# **Abstract** \n\n\n\nThis proposal introduces key updates and improvements to 1inch Protocols to enhance Protocol adoption and usage while maintaining competitiveness. By implementing technical capabilities that recognize and support technical contributors, the 1inch Network fosters long-term adoption, resilience, and efficient operations.\n\n\n\n**Incentive 1: KYC/KYB-Based Order Fulfillment in LOP:** introduces KYC/KYB-based order settlement in the 1inch Limit Order Protocol (LOP), ensuring that only verified resolvers can participate. This strengthens competition among verified participants and enhances security and trust within LOP. \n\n\n\n**Incentive 2: Technical implementation of incentives in the operational model of the Protocols:** introduces a technical capability that enables incentivization for infrastructure and product integrators in Aggregation, Limit Order, Fusion, and Fusion+ protocols, driving adoption and aligning with market practices. This upgrade allows technical contributors to implement programmatic costs at the protocol or user-facing product level, ensuring sustainable participation. Additionally, leveraging inherent protocol features such as swap surplus allocation and incentivization in third-party integrations further enhances network efficiency. \n\n\n\n# Intro: Global Motivation \n\n\n\nThe success and reach of the 1inch Network depend on technical contributors who maintain and optimize its core protocols. These contributors\u2014infrastructure and product integrators\u2014play a vital role in shaping infrastructure that powers the Network and driving Protocol usage and adoption. To ensure long-term sustainability, it is essential to introduce technical capabilities that foster a competitive and balanced ecosystem. This Protocol Upgrade introduces targeted improvements that support structured incentivization of technical contributors and enhanced protocol participation. \n\n\n\nWhile this proposal presents multiple initiatives, we believe it is beneficial to introduce them as a unified step toward a more sustainable and efficient 1inch Network.\n\n\n\n# Incentive 1: KYC/KYB-Based Order Fulfillment in LOP \n\n\n\nWe propose to limit the takers in Limit Order Protocol (LOP) only to KYC/KYB-compliant resolvers. \n\n\n\n### **Motivation and Rationale**\n\n\n\nThe proposal fulfills the general goal of preserving integrity and promoting organic incentivization in the following way: \n\n\n\n1. **Fostering healthy competition between verified resolvers in LOP, while enhancing security:** \n\n\n\nIn LOP, only resolvers who have passed KYC/KYB should be allowed to fill orders, increasing market efficiency and fostering greater competition between the resolvers. At the same time, the obligatory requirement of UP threshold is removed, allowing more resolvers to participate in order settlement (details in Incentive 2), leading to better rates for users. \n\n\n\nThe end-users of the LOP are provided with greater security as the limit order takers are limited exclusively to identified sources. \n\n\n\n2. **Incentivizing infrastructure contributors.** \n\n\n\nMandatory verification for LOP order fulfillment may also encourage greater adoption of LOP by integrators, and institutional market contributors who value a trusted and secure environment.\n\n\n\n### **Specification** \n\n\n\nRequirements to participate in order filling:\n\n\n\n* Orders within LOP can only be filled by resolvers who have successfully completed the KYC (Know Your Customer) or KYB (Know Your Business) processes. The same process is currently enabled in Fusion and Fusion+.   \n\n* This ensures that only verified contributors can interact with the LOP at this level. Any entity or individual who has passed the KYC/KYB requirements and security process will be eligible to fulfill orders in LOP.   \n\n* The tiers currently applicable to resolvers in Fusion protocol will be equally applicable to resolvers in LOP. More details are described in Incentive 2\\.\n\n\n\nIncentive 2: Technical implementation of incentives in the operational model of the Protocols\n\n\n\nWe propose implementing the technical capabilities that enable incentives for infrastructure and product integrators (the \u201c**technical contributors**\u201d) in the operational model of Aggregation, Limit Order, Fusion, and Fusion+ protocols (the \u201c**Protocols**\u201d). \n\n\n\nThe proposed change is a technical upgrade that enables technical contributors to implement the programmatic costs on the protocol level or user-facing product level as an incentive. This Protocol upgrade drives widespread adoption and usage of the Protocols, meeting the market practices.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, another inherent Protocol feature that can be used for incentivization of technical contributors is swap surplus. A structured approach to swap surplus allocation could enable contributors to benefit, while maintaining network efficiency. Expanding protocol functionality into third-party applications also necessitates incentivising the technical contributors in such integrations. \n\n\n\nThese changes strengthen the Protocols\u2019 competitiveness, foster their greater adoption and attract more contributors.\n\n\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n\n\nBy implementing this technical upgrade, 1inch DAO enhances the Protocols' functionality while also ensuring infrastructure providers and the community are recognized for their contributions.\n\n\n\nOne of DAO's fundamental objectives is to drive widespread adoption of the Protocols. Third-party integrators and infrastructure participants looking to adopt the Protocols are often discouraged by a lack of technical capability to benefit from their interactions with the Protocols on infrastructure or user-facing level.\n\n\n\nThrough the technical implementation of the incentives, allowing the technical contributors to benefit from protocol usage on various levels, we create a framework that enables broader adoption and long-term sustainability. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, swap surplus within the Protocols is a built-in mechanism that presents an additional avenue for contributors\u2019 incentivization. A structured approach to allocating surplus could ensure that technical contributors, community participants, and integrators receive recognition for their role in maintaining network efficiency. As Protocol use is also expanded to third-party applications through UI-integrated iframes the incentivization is also beneficial for the contributors maintaining such integrations.\n\n\n\nAs competitors are already utilizing similar approaches to attract integrators, the Protocols must prioritize this initiative to maintain its competitive edge in the evolving market, drive Protocol adoption and strengthen the ecosystem in general.\n\n\n\nLastly, if the technical capability that enables incentives are in place, some of the value derived on the protocol level could be allocated to the DAO or st1INCH holders for sustainable development and/or incentivization as decided by the DAO. However, this would require further community feedback, technical development, and careful consideration before implementation, to ensure that any decisions reflect the broader Network\u2019s priorities and long-term sustainability goals.\n\n\n\n**Specification**\n\n\n\nWhen implementing incentives on a protocol level any technical contributor is required to comply with the following tiered structure for resolvers, as infrastructure integrators: \n\n\n\n* Tier 1: meeting KYC/KYB requirements; meeting the 5% UP requirement \\- subject to discounted protocol costs implemented by technical contributors for deeper engagement with the Network.  \n\n* Tier 2: meeting KYC/KYB requirement; not meeting the 5% UP threshold \\- subject to regular protocol costs implemented by technical contributors.\n\n\n\n**Considerations**\n\n\n\n1. **Rate Influence.** While incentives enabled by technical contributors may impact rates, increased competition from lower entry barriers is expected to counterbalance this effect, ensuring continued market efficiency.  \n\n2. **Technical Challenges.** Changes must be implemented without disrupting existing infrastructure, preserving protocol usability and minimizing integration adjustments for contributors and resolvers.\n\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\n\nThe Protocol upgrades brought through the initiatives introduce key improvements to the Protocols, ensuring competitiveness and broader adoption while incentivising the technical contributors. By implementing targeted technical upgrades, the DAO strengthens the Protocols' long-term viability and ensures continued innovation.\n\n\n\n* **Incentive 1: KYC/KYB-Based Order Fulfillment in LOP**  \n\n  Ensures that only verified resolvers can settle limit orders, fostering healthy competition and lowering entry barriers for compliant resolvers, while enhancing security and trust for end-users.  \n\n* **Incentive 2: Technical implementation of incentives in the operational model of the Protocols:** introduces a technical capability that enables incentivization for infrastructure and product integrators in Aggregation, Limit Order, Fusion, and Fusion+ protocols, driving adoption and aligning with market practices. \n\n\n\n**Requests for key contributors:**\n\n\n\n* The 1inch Foundation, as a liaison with resolvers and other third-party contributors, is requested to communicate potential changes, collect feedback, and ensure smooth implementation of any upgrades.  \n\n* The 1inch Limited, as a key technical contributor, is requested to facilitate any necessary technical developments, ensuring that proposed gateways are implemented efficiently and securely.\n\n\n\nBy adopting this proposal and the Protocol updates, the 1inch DAO commits to a forward-looking strategy that enhances Protocol adoption, aligns with market standards, and fosters a thriving, decentralized ecosystem. The continuous involvement of the community and infrastructure contributors will ensure the long-term success of these initiatives.",

      "body": "Authored by [DAOplomats](https://DAOplomats.com)\n\n## Simple Summary\nRenew the Recognized Delegates Program for 12 months\n\n## Abstract\nInspired by the success of the second RDP, this proposal suggests renewing the Recognized Delegates Program (RDP) by 12 months and funding it with **250,000 USDC**. This move will promote further decentralisation and community led governance for the 1inchDAO.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Recognized delegates program which was proposed two years ago was able to incentivize high quality delegates to contribute to the governance of the 1inch DAO as well as incentivize new delegates to participate in the governance of the DAO. Till today 5 delegates with professional experience in governance participate in governance at 1inchDAO. Inspired by this success, we believe that renewing the current version of the program will continue to create positive change and decentralization in the governance of the 1inchDAO  \n\n## Specification\nOverview:\nA recognised delegate is an elected, paid position of reputable, diligent and qualified 1inch DAO members who work closely with the team and contribute to the growth and sustainability of the 1inchDAO.\n\nRecognized delegates fall into three categories, called \u2018Tiers\u2019, based on their performance and voting weight. Irrespective of which tier a delegate belongs to, as long as a delegate fulfils the responsibilities outlined below and gets accepted via a snapshot vote, the delegate shall be considered as a \u2018Recognized Delegate\u2019\n\n## Responsibilities:\nRead, understand, and provide feedback if necessary on governance forum posts. Always vote in the best interests of the DAO and the community over their personal interests. Actively vote on governance proposals and explain the thinking behind each vote when relevant Understand the 1inch Network, its key metrics and the overall ecosystem.\n\n## Compensation:\nThis Recognised Delegates Programme aims to attract and retain entities and individuals who will actively participate in governance on behalf of 1INCH token-holders as governance specialists. Hence we suggest compensating the delegates based on minimum participation and performance. \n\n## Delegates will be compensated based on the tiers\n\n| Delegate Tier | Monthly Compensation |\n|---------------|----------------------|\n| 1             | $100                 |\n| 2             | $500                 |\n| 3             | $4000                |\n\n**Compensation eligibility:**\nMinimum Participation: A delegate must maintain at least  \u2018x\u2019% participation rate. Participation is measured as voting in any \u201ctemperature check\u201d or a snapshot governance vote.\n\nMinimum Communication: A delegate must maintain at least  \u2018y\u2019 % communication rate. Communication is measured as providing for any \u201ctemperature check\u201d or a snapshot governance vote, a summary, a voting position, and a justification for that position. A missed vote will still require communication to avoid a lower communication rate.\n\nMinimum Delegation Threshold: To remain eligible for delegate incentives, a delegate must maintain voting weight of at least \u2018z\u2019 Unicorn Power (UP)\n\nDAO Decentralization: Delegates must participate in decentalization efforts at 1inch DAO. This could be in the form of joining existing working groups or spearheading new working groups when the need arises.\n\n| Metrics               | Tier 3 | Tier 2 | Tier 1 |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Voting Participation   | 80%    | 80%    | 80%    |\n| Communication          | 80%    | 80%    | 80%    |\n| Delegation Threshold   | 500,000| 100,000| 10,000 |\n\n*above calculations will be made from the time a delegate is accepted as a recognized delegate by the DAO by following the procedure outlined below\n\n**Procedure:**\nIn order to get accepted as a \u2018Recognized delegate\u2019 by following the process below:\n\nPhase 1: Announce your candidacy by filling the Recognized Delegate Application Template [here] and posting it to the Recognized Delegates category of the forum \n\nPhase 2: Contact relevant stakeholder to gather feedback and support\n\nPhase 3: Open a temperature check poll to gauge consensus\n\n**Recognized Delegates**:\nDAOplomats and StableLab were voted in by the 1inch DAO via governance as tier 3 recognized delegates and will continue in the same position going forward. Additionally Curia, FranklinDAO and Arana Digital will join the cohort of recognized delegates from this iteration onwards.\n\n## Rationale\nRecognized delegates play an important role in providing third party feedback for the proposals at 1inch DAO. Further each delegate brings in their own unique expertise and participates in one or several working groups at the DAO.\n\nThis renewal will promote further decentralisation and community led governance for the 1inchDAO by retaining current talent and providing incentives for new delegates to increase their activity.\n\n## Considerations\nThe DAO should takes steps in order to speed up the governance process in order to keep delegates engaged in the program In terms of budget, we suggest setting aside 250,000 USDC to run this program over 12 months. This budget includes compensation for existing delegates according to their tiers as well as a small buffer for potential new delegates who can join this program",

      "title": "[1IP-75] Offboard low-volume chains from 1inch",
      "body": "From: [DAOplomats](https://DAOplomats.com) \n\n## **Simple Summary**\nThis proposal aims to offboard Fantom, Kaia, and Aurora from the 1inch protocol due to their relatively low volume and high operational costs.\n\n## **Abstract**\nThis proposal recommends offboarding the Fantom, Kaia, and Aurora chains from the 1inch protocol due to low volume and high operational costs. These chains exhibit limited DeFi activity and growth potential, making their continued support unsustainable. The offboarding will occur on the app.1inch.io UI and API licenses offered by 1inch Labs. This action aims to optimise resource allocation and reduce unnecessary expenses for the 1inch DAO. Gnosis chain activity will be reevaluated in Q4 2025.\n\n## **Motivation**\nThe 1inch DAO has undertaken a comprehensive four-month evaluation process to assess the long-term viability of supporting various blockchain networks within the 1inch protocol. This detailed assessment aimed to determine the sustainability of maintaining 1inch Fusion and Fusion+ infrastructure across different chains. \n\nThe evaluation criteria encompassed several key areas, each providing critical insights into the performance and potential of the supported networks:\n\n![image](https://assets.commonwealth.im/b3b17da2-25d0-41ce-bfa4-04beb94db44b.png)\n\n- **Analysis of Total Trading Volume**: A fundamental aspect of the evaluation involved scrutinising the trading volume on each chain. This analysis included:\n- **All-time volume**: This metric provided a historical perspective on the cumulative trading activity, indicating the overall adoption and usage of the 1inch protocol on each network.\n\n- **30-day Fusion volume**: Focusing on the more recent trading activity, specifically through the 1inch Fusion feature, this metric offered insights into the current level of engagement and utilisation on each chain. This allowed for the identification of chains with declining usage.\n### Fantom:\n\n- All-time volume: $81,528,098.\n- 30-day volume on Fusion: $2,528,072.\n\n### Gnosis:\n- All-time volume: $1,234,093,111.\n- 30-day volume on Fusion: $7,049,111.\n### Aurora:\n- 30-day volume: $284.52K.\n### Kaia:\n- 30-day volume: $4.21k.\n### Assessment of the DeFi Ecosystem\nThe health and vitality of the decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystem on each chain were thoroughly examined. This included:\n\n### Fantom:\nThe DeFi ecosystem on Fantom experienced a significant decline following the 2022 market cycle and has struggled to recover. Data from Defillama indicates a current Total Value Locked (TVL) of approximately 55 million USD, with daily trading volumes ranging from 1 to 3 million USD. This suggests a weakening ecosystem with reduced activity.\n\n### Aurora:\nAurora, an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain within the Near ecosystem, initially showed promise but has not achieved sustained growth. While the chain witnessed substantial trading volumes in early 2022, activity has diminished considerably.\n\n# Evaluation of Growth Potential\nEach chain's long-term prospects and potential for future growth were carefully considered. This involved analysing factors such as:\n### Fantom:\nThe Fantom ecosystem is transitioning, including a significant migration and rebranding effort. The existing Fantom chain is being phased out in favour of a new product, indicating a shift in focus and potentially reduced support for the current infrastructure.\n\n### Kaia:\nThe Kaia chain resulted from the merger of the Finschia and Klaytn chains. Its strategic focus leans towards GameFi and account abstraction rather than DeFi. Kaia's Web3 hub strategy for the Asian market has not yet achieved widespread adoption and faces competition from established players with similar strategies.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nBased on above evaluation, DAOplomats recommend that the 1inch DAO offboard the following chains from the 1inch protocol:\n\n* Fantom\n* Kaia\n* Aurora\nWhile the Gnosis chain also exhibits lower activity levels, it's growth potential and emerging DeFi ecosystem led the DAOplomats to recommend reassessing its performance in Q4 2025.\n\n## **Specification**\nIf this proposal passes, The DAO signals the 1inch Labs to offboard the selected chains from the app.1inch.io, API service and other uneconomical   infrastructure related to 1inch protocol. No other service offered by 1inch will be mandated under the proposal, but 1inch Labs and other stake holders may conduct necessary measures to elevate operational sustainability of the said services.   \n\n## **Rationale**\n1inch, as a leading DEX aggregator, faces low resource utilisation on those chains due to the prevailing market conditions. \n The high operational costs and the low revenue generated make it challenging to justify the continued support for these chains.  This situation necessitates a strategic decision to optimise resource allocation and maintain the protocol's efficiency.\n\n## **Considerations**\nThe proposal only aims to offboard the abovementioned chains from the DAO-controlled infrastructure. This proposal doesn't seek to impact any API licences on the supported chain offered by 1inch Labs. A further analysis should be conducted on this.\n---\n\n**Source:**\n* https://dune.com/1inch/main\n* https://dune.com/1inch/fusion\n* https://defillama.com/protocol/1inch-network\n* https://defillama.com/chain/Fantom?govtokens=true&volume=true\n* https://dappradar.com/dapp/1inch-network/analytics?range-ha=all&chains-ha=aurora",

      "title": "[1IP-74] Messari Protocol Services 1inch Proposal 2025",
      "body": "## ABSTRACT\n\nWe propose that Messari continues to provide research and reporting services for 1inch Network in the form of Quarterly Reports. This will serve to better inform existing stakeholders and attract new ones while building out the open-source data infrastructure for the community.\n\n## ABOUT MESSARI\n\nMessari is a team of crypto natives passionate about building powerful data analytics tools for the Web3 world. The company was started in early 2018 and has since scaled to over 150 employees after raising a Series B led by Brevan Howard. Messari has also received a grant from The Graph to become a core developer. It has allowed the company to build and standardize subgraphs, creating a robust open-source data infrastructure for the broader crypto ecosystem.\n\nMessari is functionally split into two distinct units: \n\n* **Messari Enterprise**, a paywalled market intelligence platform that operates like a traditional SaaS business.\n* **Messari Protocol Services**, which provides research and reporting services on behalf of protocols and DAOs. The entirety of the work from the underlying data infrastructure to the reports themselves are open sourced and publicly available. Therefore, the work is sustained based on grants from projects whether through the development team, grants program, or DAO treasury funding. \n\nThis proposal is coming on behalf of Messari Protocol Services. \n\n## PROPOSAL BREAKDOWN\n\nQuarterly Reports Four (4) Quarterly reports on 1inch that present and analyze KPIs and fundamental metrics including:\n\n* Financial metrics: circulating market cap, fully diluted market cap, circulating supply, total supply, token inflation, revenue, staking yield, treasury balance, treasury expenditures\n* Network metrics: transactions (successful, failed, total), active addresses, new addresses, average transaction fees, contract calls, contract callers, address retention, days active per address, transactions per address, contracts interacted with per address\n* 1inch Network specific metrics:  daily average external volume, daily average transactions, total 1inch staked, and treasury balance\n\nExamples: [State of 1inch Q2\u201924](https://messari.io/report/state-of-1inch-q2-2024), [State of 1inch Q1\u201924](https://messari.io/report/state-of-1inch-q1-2024)\n \n![](ipfs://bafybeic2tsmnb7z3lruewsjuwiypmzemxgeebzy6az3xxklkj4pfbxtb6y)\n\n## RATIONALE\n\n### Surfacing on-chain metrics and key developments\n\nThese reports better inform existing stakeholders through recurring, data-driven research from trusted, independent analysts. The actionable insights generated from these reports will better educate them on the economic, financial, and social health of 1inch, whether it\u2019s a surge in trading volume across a certain market or the implications of a major upgrade or governance decision. There are compounding effects to this as various stakeholders are able to leverage our work to further their goals. \n\nExample - Gauntlet [using](https://twitter.com/gauntletnetwork/status/1664310367718350848?s=20) Messari\u2019s assessment of interest rate optimizations on protocol revenue to further quantify the impact. \n\n### Facilitate protocol business development\n\nThis information gets sent out to over 360,000 of our subscribers of which \u2153 comprises most of the top crypto-native builders in the space. By continuing to deliver high-quality information around 1inch\u2019s mechanics and real traction, it increases the likelihood of more projects building on and integrating with 1inch.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen Messari\u2019s reporting frequently end up on major DAO governance forums (deploying Uniswap on [Filecoin VM](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-on-filecoin-virtual-machine-fvm/21309) and [Avalanche](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-on-avalanche/20587)) \n \n![](ipfs://bafybeicht4nnnjxjod2kuq5xejmyphlxxjemb6muhhifwqpz25cn3a72gy)\n\n### Institutional adoption\n\nExisting mainstream coverage of crypto is woefully lacking. Investment banking and sell-side equity research coverage of crypto fails to paint an accurate picture of the material developments in this industry. When it comes to DeFi and even more nuanced aspects of this industry, things only get worse. \n\nTo combat this Messari has spent significant resources getting onboarded to many of the largest traditional research platforms in the world, including the Bloomberg Terminal, S&P Capital IQ, and Refinitiv. This goes a long way to further professionalize the projects we work with to the vast majority of major funds, banks, financial service companies, and large corporations in the world. After reading these reports, these entities will better grasp the magnitude of economic activity generated by the protocol.\n\nThere are trillions of dollars in AUM represented by the consumers of these platforms, so even a small percentage of users consuming this information and acting on it can drive meaningful activity on-chain.\n\n### Distribution Metrics\n\nBloomberg Terminal: 325,000 users\nS&P Global Capital IQ: 12,000 enterprises \nRefinitiv: 400,000 users\n\n### Additional Stats (Refinitiv + S&P)\n\n13 asset managers >$100b\n22 asset managers >$1b \n5 hedge funds >$50b \n11 hedge funds >$1b \nAggregate AUM: $12.2 trillion  \n12 Enterprises (Mkt cap: +$750b)\n\n### Commitment to transparency\n\nFunding this reporting underscores 1inch\u2019s proactive commitment to transparency, public awareness, and accountability, both fundamental principles in this industry. It sends positive signals to potential users, clients, and partners.\n\n## PRICING & RESOURCES\n\n\u201cState of 1inch\u201d Quarterly Reports cost $22.5k USD each, totaling a $90k contract for 12-15 months of collaboration. This goes towards funding:\n\n* **Research.** Messari analysts spend several weeks researching and writing each report, along with an extensive internal editing and review process by the broader team. \n* **Data Science and Engineering.** Each report will have its own dedicated data science and engineering resources tasked with providing all the relevant raw data. This requires ingesting large amounts of data which is housed in a data warehouse, incurring storage and compute costs. \n* **Distribution.** Messari has several members of the team working on distribution for these reports across all of Messari\u2019s channels along with the thirdparty partners.",

      "title": "[1IP-72] Engagement of New Legal Counsel for 1inch DAO",
      "body": "# Simple Summary\n\n\n\n* Approve MME Legal AG as legal counsel of 1inch DAO;  \n\n* Grant MME Legal AG power of attorney to represent 1inch DAO; and  \n\n* Approve an initial advance payment of 50\u2019000 USDC.\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n\n\n\nFollowing the adoption of [1IP-70](https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0xa69eaff3a11464bada4f8269868aae1f920c38bf6569dee51508f423985ed793) which, amongst others, revoked STORM Partners legal counsel status and the accompanying power of attorney, it is necessary to appoint a new legal counsel. \n\n\n\nThe Legal Communications Working Group (\u201cLCWG\u201d) established by the above-mentioned 1IP proposes that 1inch DAO engages MME Legal AG (\u201cMME\u201d) as its new legal counsel, following discussions conducted with this Swiss law firm.\n\n\n\n# Motivation\n\n\n\n**Complex Operational Environment.** Despite the notable expansion and evolution of DAOs over the last years, this type of organizations is still struggling to determine the exact scope of the regulatory and compliance responsibilities across the wide range of situations triggered by their diverse activities. In particular, the constant and fast paced evolution of the regulatory environment renders complicated for DAOs to determine the level of compliance appropriate considering their protocol\u2019s function and risk profile, the beliefs and ethos held by the community, as well as many other relevant factors. With MME\u2019s assistance, 1inch DAO can strengthen its standing as a responsible and legally sound organization, proactively navigating the regulatory landscape, and effectively protecting the interests of its stakeholders.\n\n\n\n**Reputable Law Firm**. MME has a proven track record in the blockchain industry, having guided many prominent players in the space since 2014, including the Ethereum Foundation. Its extensive team of Web3-native legal experts brings relevant expertise across a wide range of Web3 projects, enabling the firm to provide pragmatic and compliant solutions to the challenges DAOs may encounter in their operations. \n\n\n\n**Signaling A Responsible Approach.** This engagement would send a clear signal to the community and potential regulators that 1inch DAO is committed to \u201cdoing the right thing.\u201d By partnering with a reputable law firm with a strong track record, 1inch DAO demonstrates its dedication to responsibly assessing the scope of its risks and responsibilities. MME's firsthand experience in observing the industry's evolution, as well as shifting regulatory approaches, positions it uniquely to support 1inch DAO in navigating this landscape.\n\n\n\n**Comprehensive Support**. DAOs, while inherently global, are connected to real-world factors that tie them to overlapping legal frameworks. Therefore, this proposal aims to engage a law firm that can provide advice considering the many foreign DAO frameworks adopted across the globe, and liaising, when necessary, with foreign lawyers. With MME, the DAO will benefit from a strong international network and comprehensive legal support for events with legal implications. Notably, MME will support with: \n\n\n\n* **Drafting Expertise**: MME will provide valuable guidance in drafting and reviewing contracts and governance proposals, ensuring they align with the DAO's objectives and comply with legal standards.   \n\n* **Risk Mitigation**: MME will provide risk mitigation strategies, including the development of robust policies and procedures and providing guidance on mitigating legal liabilities.  \n\n* **Dispute Resolution**: In the event of legal disputes, MME will represent the DAO's interests, providing expert advice and advocating for fair resolutions. Having legal representation strengthens the DAO's position and protects the rights of its stakeholders.\n\n\n\n# Practicalities\n\n\n\nThis section outlines the practical aspects related to the collaboration between MME and 1inch DAO in the context of their engagement as legal counsel. \n\n\n\n**General Terms.** The services provided by MME are subject to the applicable service terms of MME which were made accessible to and reviewed by the LCWG.\n\n\n\n**Communication Channel.** The LCWG is responsible for coordinating communications between 1inch DAO and MME. As such, it will act as the sole point of contact with MME to ensure streamlined and consistent communication. Both the LCWG and MME will designate a dedicated point of contact to manage and forward communications within their respective teams as needed. \n\n\n\n**Confidentiality vs Transparency.** To safeguard the interests of the DAO, all communications between the LCWG and MME will remain confidential. However, to ensure transparency and accountability, the LCWG will prepare quarterly reports summarizing key topics, their status, and the solutions adopted, provided such disclosure is legally permissible. These reports will also include an overview of legal fees, ensuring ongoing financial oversight and fostering trust within the DAO community.\n\n\n\nWhen appropriate or necessary, and with MME's consent, the LCWG will share relevant legal documentation with the broader DAO community. This approach will keep members informed about events that affect or could potentially impact them directly, fostering transparency and proactive communication within the DAO.\n\n\n\n**Ongoing Check-In Meetings**. To ensure effective oversight of all legal matters, it is proposed that the LCWG holds regular check-in calls with MME. These meetings will provide an opportunity to review ongoing matters, discuss potential legal implications, and define actionable steps. Objectives of these calls are the following:\n\n\n\n* Given that the LCWG may not possess the expertise to independently assess all issues requiring legal intervention, these regular discussions will help ensure no critical matters are overlooked, and thus prevent actions that could lead to adverse legal consequences.  \n\n* Additionally, the meetings will serve as a platform to review legal expenses incurred on previously raised matters, enabling continuous monitoring of legal fees. \n\n\n\n**Urgent Requests.** Beyond the Check In Meetings, any matter requiring legal input and which cannot wait until the following meeting will be submitted by the LCWG to MME in writing.\n\n\n\n**Conflict of interest**. As legal counsel of 1inch DAO, MME represents the interest of the DAO. Accordingly, MME may and will not be able to represents individual interests of DAO members or members of the LCWG in any internal disputes. \n\n\n\n**Payment and Invoicing.** The engagement process requires the DAO\u2019s approval of advance payments, which MME will invoice against for its services. This approach ensures clear financial arrangements with MME and promoting transparent and accountable use of resources. Funds will be allocated to the 1inch DAO Operations Multisig `0x45e84e10e8E85c583C002A40007D10629EF80fAF`, then transferred to MME.\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Advance Payments**: An initial advance payment of 50\u2019000 USD (in ETH or USDC) will be transferred to MME as a retainer to initiate the legal engagement and enable MME to begin providing legal support to 1inch DAO. In the event of termination of this mandate, MME will return any remaining advance payments to the blockchain address from which the initial payment was received.\n\n\n\n* **Invoicing and Billing**: The services will be invoiced on an hourly fee basis. At the end of each calendar month, MME will provide invoices for its services rendered to 1inch DAO. The invoices will be detailed and itemized, clearly outlining the services provided, corresponding hourly rates fees, and any applicable taxes or disbursements. All invoices sent by MME will be reviewed and approved by the LCWG. Upon such approval, the invoiced amounts will be deducted from the advance payments.\n\n\n\n* **Replenishment and Additional Approvals**: The committee will review the need to replenish the advance payment funds every three months, taking into account the progress of legal services and the remaining balance. Any decision to replenish the advance payment amounts will be subject to the internal governance process of 1inch DAO and require a separate governance proposal.  \n\n    \n\n* **Expense Tracking and Reporting**: The LCWG will maintain accurate records of all advance payment amounts, invoices, and services rendered. The LCWG will include the utilization of the pre-payment amounts and the remaining balance in its quarterly reports to ensure full transparency. Any questions raised by DAO members regarding invoicing will be directed to the LCWG, and if necessary, the LCWG will submit them to MME for clarification.",
